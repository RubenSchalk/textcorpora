              "Florence has this day been the scene of a drama hitherto perhaps unknown in the world-a blood- less revolution. A week since the throne of the Grand Duke seemed no more insecure than that of most Italian Potentates in times of popular com- motion; for the last few days, however, the ex- citement has been gradually rising among all classes burning to know the course the Grand Duke in- tended to pursue in the now inevitable struggle. The procrastination of the Court has vastly increased this feeling, and though a week since a declaration of neutrality might possibly have checked for the mo- ment the passions of the people, it was felt through- out yesterday that nothing short of an immediate decision in favour of Piedmont could prevent a popular demonstration, which could have but one issue. General Ferrari the head of the Tuscan forces, yesterday sent in his resignation, while bands of soldiers and citizens paraded the streets, singing patriotic songs and mingling the names of VictorEmmauuelaudItalianindependence. Through- out the day emisaries of the National party might be seen posting up addresses to the citizens in the most public manner, urging them to throw off the yoke of Austria, and rise in behalf of Italian independence. At an eArly hour this morning, the people (to the number\n",
              "of 20,000) asembled in the Piazza Santa Maria Antonia. Hlere the tricolour of Italy was raised, amid rapturous acclamations, and bands of men of all classes, soldiers and citizens, dispersed them- selves in every direction ; each troop led by a bearer of the national standard. In less than an hour the tricolour was floating over the tower of the Palazzo Vecchio and the fortresses of S. Giorgio and S. Giovanni. The greater portion of the assembly proceeded at once to the Palace of the French M[inister, who thanked the people for their sympathies with the Emperor and France. They then proceeded to the Sardinian Ambassdors. Amid a thousand vivas and the waving of binners he pre- sented himself to the people; reminded them that the eyes of Italy and Piedmont were upon them; exhorted them to respect religion, law, and pro- perty; recommended discipline to the army, quiet and order to all. \"\"\"\" The moment will come,\"\"\"\" he ex- claimed, \"\"\"\"nay, isnowat hand,whenyouwill be called upon to employ your arms in defence of your country He next announced that the Grand Duke had de- clared his intention of abandoning Tuscany, de- manded in the name of Victor Emmanuel and the national honour, that respact should be paid to his peason, and trusted that the citizens would obey the Government that would be organized to meet the present emergency. He then disclaimed on the part of Sardinia any intention of interfering in the affairs of Tuscany, farther than to provide for the public tranquillity and the exigencies of war. The object for which Piedmont drcw the sword was inde. pendence, not ambition. Let them all rememberthat\n",
              "liberty was only acquired by great sacrificesby acts of virtue and entire obedience. Under these circiumL stances the Grand Duke, at an early hour, called upon Don Neri Corsini, Marquis of Lajatico, to aid hia counsels. On his declaring that abdication in favour of his son was the only course that could save the succession, the Grand Duke summoned the corps diploraatique and declared that he preferred quitting the country to condescending to this step. Before the public announcement of tnis the scene before the Palazzo Pitti was most exciting. The very guards and servants of the Grand Duke had mounted the tricolour, while thousands were moving to and fro across the grand piazza. The most im- portant fact was the perfect command which the leaders of the people seemed to possess over each and all. They might be seen going from group to group recommending order i Il tranquillity. Throughout the entire day no single&amp;ct of turbu- lence occurred, as far as I have been able to dig- cover. The cause of this can only be found in the entire unanimity of the people in their hatred of Austria, which so far from being confined to Lombardy and Piedmont is universal through- out the Peninsula. Before 4 in the after- noon it was known that the Grand Duke would quit Tuscany with all his family rather than abdi- cate in favour of the Hereditary Archduke. An address was immediately issued to the people, de. claring that Leopold II., though his opinions coin- cided with those of Tuscany, was on the point of abandoning his country a second time, with al his family. In order to avoid allowing the country to run the risk of a state of anarchy, a Junto was in process of formation, which 'without wishing in any way to influence the future, would undertake to maintain order and give up its authority at the earliest Dossible moment. In the meantime, the wishes of the army of Tuscany would be satisfied, and the Dictatorship of Tuscany offered to Victor Emmanuel during the war. ,\n",

After an ex- hortstion to order, the first and most solemn act of patriotism, the address wound up with the state- ment that the names of the provisional Government would be given at the earliest moment.\n",
              "At S the Gruan Duke, with his family and a band of officers (to see him safely to the froatier), left Florence by the Porta Romano, and, crossing the iron bridge above the city, made the circuit of the walls, and followed the road to Bologna from the Porta San Gallo.

              "WVhy, let us ask, should it cause auy commotion if an interview is contemplated between the Prince Rlegent of PrassiA and the Emperor of the FrrNscu ? Such a meeting, we are assured, is likely to take place at Baden Baden -within a few days, but why should it create any uieasintess or suggest alarm for the settlement of Europe ? Crowned heads have often met, and visits have been interchangted between the ExTrexor aud Queen VTwrosnA. Why, then, should this in- ,erview fill statesmen w-ith speculations and Cabinets with conjectures? The explanation is so notorious that it would be mere afiectation to dissemble the truth. People fear that it imports some new disturbance; that it is tho first act in a new Emropean drama; that Prussia will be sounded about the Rhenish provinces as S.ardinia was sounded about Savoy; that the temptation of cqluivalents may be again forthcoming, and that possibly some fresh annexation may ultimately follow a fresh con- ference and a fresh campaibrn. That is the current talk. Those are the apprehensions now coimmonly prevailing, and who can say they are unwarrant- able ? If we could but assume, which ve are neither entitled nor disposed to do, that Prassia is ns amenable to management as Sardinia was, no might forecast the future with almost as muic'L contidence as we foretell a stormi from the indica- tions of a barometer, and carry two courses of e3vents in two parallel lines from B3aden laden and Plombic?res.

              "All this is closely in accordance with thc tradi- tions of the First Empire, and of that reign which LOUIS NAAPoLEON naturally regards with admira- tion aud affection. For some ten or twelve years a:t the commencement of the century there was a continual redistribution of European territory, and the licence taken by the First ; NArOLEoX in these niatters was most extravagant. Very recently, too, the historian of those times, MI. THIEnS, has reverted to some of the ideas of the period. In lhis last volume of the Cons\"\"\"\"l.ate ranl tilc Enpire, not once, but repeatedly, and as if expressing an in- contestablo trutbh, o speaks of the Phino and the Alps as the \"\"\"\"natural frontiers\"\"\"\" of France, and directly contrasts those limits, not only with the boundaries imposed in 1815, but witlh the frontiers existing before the wars of the Revolution began. It does not occur to him to reflect that if the Alps and the Rhine are the \"\"\"\" natural\"\"\"\" frontiers of France, nature has never yet prevailed in the arrangement of those frontiers, for there never -was a time, save during the brief convulsions of a revolution, when the French monarchy was tihs bounded. Those, however, are his expres- sions, and they point so clearly to a French \"\"\"\"ideiV' that nobody can mistake their pturport. 'We are ,old that France is now strong, and that she is justified In protesting against the Treaties of iSL;, imposed upon her whon she was weak.

Xone of the old bar- gains bore any good fruit, and, if The suspicions of Europe on the present occasion rest on any sound foundation, the prospect is a bad one. The French Empire can be consolidated and extended in a far better fashion than this. More was lost than gained by the annexation of Savoy and l!ce. That proceeding was the first cause of the unpopularity of the French Treaty in this country. We might have put up wNith a little dis- advantage in the terms of the bargain, and looked with iudulgence on Protectionist delusions, which, for that matter, we had not long discarded ourselves. WVhat unsettled our views was the discovery that, though France could make a Commercial Treaty with England, she could, at the same time, make treaties quite uncommercial with other States, and that, while she kept 600,000 soldiers in arms, she wvas ready to go to war for an \"\"\"\"idea.\"\"\"\"\n",
              "It is not in any spirit of national jealousy that such feelings are entertained on this side of the Chlanel. WVe do not consider that in any balance of power the strength of France is materially increased by the acquisition of Savoy. WVe should not even much concern onrselves if such increase of strength had actually accrued. WVe know very well that, as far as the power of nations goes, France is far more likely to gain by cultivating the arts of peace than by trying the chances of war. She would be stronger after five yea:s of peaca and disarmament than after ten years of even successful campaigns. iL TamRs, in the volume w-e have already quoted, draws an impressive picture of the condition to which his country had been reduced by those \"\"\"\" vie- \"\"\"\" tories and conquests,\"\"\"\" to which Frenchmen still turn with exultation and pride. The end of all these triumphs was, that even before a single battalion of the Allies had crossed the Rhine France tvas in a state of ruin. The resources of the late dominant and conquering 3Empire were so exhausted that muskets could not be found for the troops levied in haste against the invaders, and such, but for the incomparable genius of the EzrEisoin, was the defenceless position of the nation, that the Allies, if they could have suspected so astounding a truth, might have marched to Paris without a halt at the French frontier. All this was the fruit of war ; and it shows how truly the interests of Franice, no Icss than those of Europe, require that the Second Empire should indeed be based upon peace.

This announcement, though Teally important, and calculated to raise some very grave questions, will be received as a matter of course by the public, so entirely has it been anticipated, from the date of the rebellion itself, not to say earlier. For oue reason or another no one was prepared to see SMirTH O'BRnrm dying the death of a malefactor. The scaffold was either too ignominious, too dignified, or too grave for so silly and contemptible an offender. Ire is not an assassin, Eike THisTLEWOOD; he iS not a murderer, lke GQEENrACRE; he is not a patriot, lke WALLACE; but simply a spoilt child who, partlyfrom pique, partly from imitation, chose to play at the gamte of rebellion. Vanity pointed out the only. pouible line in which-S&amp;fr O'BRIEN could hope to be distinguished. Without habits of business, with- out genius, without cotmmon sense, and, above all, without temper, lie courted a people who would not trust him, a clergy who betrayed him, a party which would neither obey him nor manage itself-all in the vain expectation that he would step into the seat of O'CONNELL, and pass thence, perhaps, to the presidency of a republic, if not the traditionary throne of his ancestors. We have seen in this country and in the Senate, that he made himself the jeat of the zation by his peevish and pointless obstinacy. We say it with aU seriousness, that the soleow execution of such a crack-brained mounte- bank would have shocked the national sentiment as much as if the dread ceremonial were performed on a monkey, or a fifth-formschoolboy. We say this of OWB=rN, but really the same applies to all. Their rebellion has been only a Christmas mummery a little out of season.\n",

Ever the tounsel-for. the defence has told the jury, that the prisoners did not know what they were saying ir doing. In the case of EIAGiiER, especially, the jury were entreated to suppose that this lo- quacious and headstrong stripling, had learned X heap of common places about tyranny, patriotism, republicanism, and so forth, and then, in the casual excitement of the crisis, had poured forth a set of senseless philippics in the fdlseto tone of a debating society,or intheunconsciousness of amesmeric france. The jury very properly declined to make themselves responsible for a plea which would have given aU the madcaps and fools in the empire special licence to rebel. As long as the plea of idiotcy was not expressly urged, it was necessary to treat the pri- soners as sane. The punishimient, however, is another question, and one which admits of more considera- tions. Among those considerations ideas of fitness come in, and every body feels that wholesome discipline at Bermuda, of home other safe retire- ments, would suit Mr. MEAGUER!S complaint muich better than the gaRlows.\n",

We fear that [the blood of innocent myriads will still flew through a foolish scruplosity for the life of the rebel. If anybody deserves death on the scaffold, it is the man who arrays citizen against citizen who stains the homnely pavement with the blood of peaceful men, who opens endless qirels, andthrows- the State into confusion,merely because'hehas X fancy for some theory. of government which has never been tried, or because;, ot being: satisfied with his place in. te existing system, he hopes to better him- sell in a scramble.

The induigence of a wan- ton and selfish ambition, at the certain cost of both guilty and innocent blood, is murder and something more. They who are guilty of such crimes deserve an ignominious death. When justice speaks unequi- vocally nothing should be allowed to contravene her decision, except a clear case for mercy or prudence. It may be a wise mercy, or a merciful prudence, to mitigate the punishment. But to forgive desperate, hard-headed, and hard-hearted offenders, who have long meditated the crime, and who are certain to re- peat iton the first opportunity, is neither mercy nor prudence. Justice it certa,ily is not., Let not the doom of the murderer be tlpught too'much for the crime, or too bae for ther'iik:of sulch men.

              "3My dear,-Since I wrote last we bave iffered much and severely, And are- still mncertain what may await us. You have probably Iearned from the public papers that our anxious anticipations of a revolution were continuilly ang- menting. The Goeernment was as much awake to the zymptoms as ourselres, and at three different periods innumerable arrests have tal-en place, each serving to exasperate yet more the youthful portion of our population, who believed that their turn to revolt was- come, for more thanl15years cannot pass without a newgeneration'srenewing the attempts in which their parents have hitherto failed. Our youth have been always the first to rise, and now, more tlhan ever, it has been the very young who have insisted on making tho attempt. In rain the rational refused to take part, with them, saying, \"\"\"\"It is impossible-this is not the moment-let us wait,\"\"\"\"-tkey could not understand thia language, aiid their plans were arranged, extending to every part of ancient Poland: it is even said (and it ia the enemy who say it) that their measures were well concerted. But the Russian police got scent of these plans, and revealed the whole to the Prussian Government, in consequence of which, such enormous numbers were arrested that no snovement) took place here. But it had been arranged that the revolution should commezce everywhere on the same day-at Cracow, where the Government had not been forewarned as it was here, the Austrians on duty in the town were driven out-everything was done In the most admirable order, and with extreme mildness. Except- ing that the Russian and Austrian.eagles were broken and trampled in the dirt, no kind of Tiolence was committed, nor any.spirit of revenge shown, though God knows, the pro- vocation of long years of oppression was not wanting. Those who desired to leave Cracow were at liberty to do so, ana a guard even was given to the Prussian Consul who remained in the town. The previsions government'was fornmed of respectable and moderate persons, and. not a drop of blood was shed, for the Austrians, as usual, fled as soon as they perceived the probability of danger.\n",
              "InGaliciathingshave takenamostmelancholyturn. During the 50 years that Gallicia has belonged to the Austrians, they have done all in their power to persuade the people that it had always formed a part of Austria-that Poland had obtained possession of it for some years, and that those years had been very unhappy for the country-that the Poles were their enemies and always treated them as a conquered people, and that since Austria had repossessed herself of Gallicia, the inhabitants were far more happy, and ought to bless their adorable Sovereign and his Go-vern. ment. You, who have so long resided there, know how adorable theyare, and how happy the people; but it is not difficult to persuade those who have no means of knowing better, that things aremuch werse eisewhere. On the other hand, during the last ten years, communist emissaries from Prance havebeen working on this poor people, promising them a revolution iRn which they should first get rid of the nobles, and then share their lands and riches among themselves. There two influences, though emanating from different prin- ciples, tended to the same result-that of setting tho pea- sants against the proprietors. lVhen the revolution of Cra- cow broke out, the GoverDment in Gallicia took the alarm, and formed.guards of safety, composed of the peasants, to whom arms were given, and on the first indication of re- velt (some horses being taken by force from a post-master), a reward oftl florins good money (equivalent to 11. sterling), was promised for every insurgent, living or dead, who should be given up to the Austrian authorities. The spies and agents of the Austrian Government then played their part, intoxicating the peasauts, in order to produce in them the proper degree of excitement, and thus inducing them to massacre some, individuals who attempted to defend them. selves. The promised reward for these bodies having been paid, and the pilage of their houses tolerated, the peasants attacked all they met, in the streets, on the public roads, and even in the houses, and a horrible massacre took place.\n",
              "The troops of the republic of Cracow had repaired to Gal- licia, intending to join the revolution which was to have begun simultaneously with that of Cracow ; but they were met by Austrian regiments far more numerous than them- selves, and receiving no aid from the inhabitants, who had been already massacred, they were defeated and mostly cut to pieces by the excited peasants, the Austrian authorities continuing to pay for every dead bedy brought in, and the Austrian troops looking on, without endeavouring to prevent any of these horrors. I feel, while writing these details, that you wil have difficulty in be- lieving them, and that these to whom they are related must suppose them to be exaggerated, but ray husbahd has just arrived fromn Gailicia, having performed a part of the journey in company with the Vice-President of that province (indeed, it would have beon impossible at that moment to haTe travelled otherwise), and the Vice-President told him that in the whole circle of Tarnow there were not more than three or four proprietors who had escaped the massacre. You mayimagine in what a state we have been. lYhen my husband arrived here, advantage vwas taken of his name to spread the report that he had returned from Galicia, where he had been to commence the revolution, that it had broken out everywhere, that it was quite time to begin it here, aitd that it was disgraeeful that the Government should have so easily succeeded in suppressing it at Posen. Many poor dupes believed this, and an attempted attack on Posen was the consequence; but having neither chief nor plan, and with many spies among theit number, they naturally failed, some were kiled, many arrested, and among them several people in the employ of my husband, which led to the belief that he was concerned in it. Here then was fresh cause for anxiety-a prison awaited him, and for some days we were every moment expecting him to be arrested; this, however, tormented me less than the rest, for, as he positively had nothing to do with it, I had no doubt the truth would soon be evident, and it appears that it is so, for he has not been molested.\n",
              "The students of the college here being suspected, orders were given to four of the masters to visit their homes, and search for arms and other proofs. This, vwhich is the busi. nese of the agents of police, the masters very properly re- fused to do, therefore the college has been closed, it is said for six weeks, but some think altogether. A second college at Tzemaszno is also closed, because suspicions have been awakened as to the fidelity of the pupils to the principles there iRculcated. This is a great calamity. The Govern. ment is now pursuing a sstem of petty prosecutions, with demnonstrations of hatred and revenge towards the entire province, and even towards individuals in no ;way connected with the late movements, which appear to me very dange- rous and ill-advised, for they tend to exasperate those who are most disposed to remain quiet. It is said, that the people in the kingdom (Russian Poland) are beginning to rise; but we have no poitive news, allare intercepted. God knows how it will end. You may conceive that, in such a state of things it ig difficult to find time for letter-writing.

A week since the throne of the Grand Duke seemed no more insecure than that of most Italian Potentates in times of popular com- motion; for the last few days, however, the ex- citement has been gradually rising among all classes burning to know the course the Grand Duke in- tended to pursue in the now inevitable struggle. The procrastination of the Court has vastly increased this feeling, and though a week since a declaration of neutrality might possibly have checked for the mo- ment the passions of the people, it was felt through- out yesterday that nothing short of an immediate decision in favour of Piedmont could prevent a popular demonstration, which could have but one issue. General Ferrari the head of the Tuscan forces, yesterday sent in his resignation, while bands of soldiers and citizens paraded the streets, singing patriotic songs and mingling the names of VictorEmmauuelaudItalianindependence. Through- out the day emisaries of the National party might be seen posting up addresses to the citizens in the most public manner, urging them to throw off the yoke of Austria, and rise in behalf of Italian independence. At an eArly hour this morning, the people (to the number\nof 20,000) asembled in the Piazza Santa Maria Antonia. Hlere the tricolour of Italy was raised, amid rapturous acclamations, and bands of men of all classes, soldiers and citizens, dispersed them- selves in every direction ; each troop led by a bearer of the national standard. In less than an hour the tricolour was floating over the tower of the Palazzo Vecchio and the fortresses of S. Giorgio and S. Giovanni. The greater portion of the assembly proceeded at once to the Palace of the French M[inister, who thanked the people for their sympathies with the Emperor and France. They then proceeded to the Sardinian Ambassdors. Amid a thousand vivas and the waving of binners he pre- sented himself to the people; reminded them that the eyes of Italy and Piedmont were upon them; exhorted them to respect religion, law, and pro- perty; recommended discipline to the army, quiet and order to all. \"\"\"\" The moment will come,\"\"\"\" he ex- claimed, \"\"\"\"nay, isnowat hand,whenyouwill be called upon to employ your arms in defence of your country He next announced that the Grand Duke had de- clared his intention of abandoning Tuscany, de- manded in the name of Victor Emmanuel and the national honour, that respact should be paid to his peason, and trusted that the citizens would obey the Government that would be organized to meet the present emergency. He then disclaimed on the part of Sardinia any intention of interfering in the affairs of Tuscany, farther than to provide for the public tranquillity and the exigencies of war. The object for which Piedmont drcw the sword was inde. pendence, not ambition. Let them all rememberthat\nliberty was only acquired by great sacrificesby acts of virtue and entire obedience. Under these circiumL stances the Grand Duke, at an early hour, called upon Don Neri Corsini, Marquis of Lajatico, to aid hia counsels. On his declaring that abdication in favour of his son was the only course that could save the succession, the Grand Duke summoned the corps diploraatique and declared that he preferred quitting the country to condescending to this step. Before the public announcement of tnis the scene before the Palazzo Pitti was most exciting. The very guards and servants of the Grand Duke had mounted the tricolour, while thousands were moving to and fro across the grand piazza. The most im- portant fact was the perfect command which the leaders of the people seemed to possess over each and all. They might be seen going from group to group recommending order i Il tranquillity. Throughout the entire day no single&amp;ct of turbu- lence occurred, as far as I have been able to dig- cover. The cause of this can only be found in the entire unanimity of the people in their hatred of Austria, which so far from being confined to Lombardy and Piedmont is universal through- out the Peninsula. Before 4 in the after- noon it was known that the Grand Duke would quit Tuscany with all his family rather than abdi- cate in favour of the Hereditary Archduke. An address was immediately issued to the people, de. claring that Leopold II., though his opinions coin- cided with those of Tuscany, was on the point of abandoning his country a second time, with al his family. In order to avoid allowing the country to run the risk of a state of anarchy, a Junto was in process of formation, which 'without wishing in any way to influence the future, would undertake to maintain order and give up its authority at the earliest Dossible moment. In the meantime, the wishes of the army of Tuscany would be satisfied, and the Dictatorship of Tuscany offered to Victor Emmanuel during the war. ,\nGeneral Uloa (it continued) the illustrious de- fender of Venic e, was already on his way to Florence,\nsent by the King of Piedmont. The Tuscan army would be proud to find him at its head. After an ex- hortstion to order, the first and most solemn act of patriotism, the address wound up with the state- ment that the names of the provisional Government would be given at the earliest moment.\nAt S the Gruan Duke, with his family and a band of officers (to see him safely to the froatier), left Florence by the Porta Romano, and, crossing the iron bridge above the city, made the circuit of the walls, and followed the road to Bologna from the Porta San Gallo. At 11 o'clock the most perfect tranquillity reigned throughout the city.\nAPRrL 28.\nAt an early hour this morning the foltowing pro- clamation appeared:-\n\"\"\"\" The Grand Dake and his Government, sooner than satisfy the just demands of the country manifested in so many ways and for so long a time, have abandoned it to it- self.

This rumour was denied by the Consfifutionnel and the Patie, but without much effect, in consequence, perhaps, of the support given by those journals to the policy of the President of the Republic. A cor- respondence has, however, been published which must set the question at rest: the contradiction given to it by Count d'Argout, the Governor of the Bank, is, at all events, entitled to some respect. It is as follows:-\n\"\"\"\" 'Monsieur is Gouverneur,-It has been rumoured that on tho occasion of late events, 1, as Minister of Finance withdrew from the Bank a sum of 25,0G0,000f. You know that this rumoar bas no foundation, that I confined myself in my despatch of the 27th November to making known to you the intention of the Goveranmett to dispose of that sum, in virtue of the treaty of the 30:h June, 1848, and that I left the Ministry without having withdrawn the 25,000,000, which I wished to keep in reserve for the public Eexvice.

Symptoms of disturbance bave already manifested themselves in this region of the south, and the evil would assume much more grave propor- tions if the Government did not hasten to apply a remedy by mneans of tho mnost prompt and vigorous measures. On no point of the territory bave secret societies been orga- nized with more union and audacity. They propagat, everywhere the most subversive doctrines, and prepare in sume sort the eventualities of an insurrection. It is impor- tant, therefore, to tranquillize honest men,who are oppressed and menaced with impunity by a minority of agitators. With this view, I have the honour to submit to your sanction a decree, declaring the deparlmonts of the H6rault and the t;ard in a state of siege.'\n\"\"\"\" The above report is followed in the Monitour bXy a decree of the President of the same date, de claring these two departments in a state of siege.\n\"\"\"\" The Minister of the Interior has sent a circular to the prefects of departments, containing in- structions relative to the taking of votes in the tsppeal to the people. The following are the prin- cspal points:-\n'The votes are to be taken on the 20th and 21st inst. The electors are to be the persons who would be entitled to vote in virtue of the Electoral Law of the 1:5th March, 1849 -tbat is to say, all thoeo not labouring under coetain speci. tied diequalifications, who are 21 years of age, and have re. sided six months at least in a commnune. The lists are to bo published at the latest on tho 16th, and are to be definitivelv closed on the 19th. Citizens whose narnes are omitted may call ou the mayors or hJues de e)aLv to insert thom. The votirz is to be continued each day from 8 O'clock to 4. Whs,e thie population is too large to vote entirely in one place, sections may be established. The presidency of the bureau of the voting places is to bo occupied by mayors, deputy-mayors, and munioipal councillore, or ia their ab. sence by persons delegated by iuges de paiar. Each bureau is to consist of a president, four assessors, and a secretary chosen by them from amongst the electors. The asaessors are to be taken from amongst the municipal councillora in the order of inscription, unless tho je'ges de psa; shall have directly proceeded to designate them. Electors are to bring their voting papers ready prepared. They are to contain the word Yes or No, as an answer to the proposition submitted to the people by the President of the Republic They enay be printed or written, and are to be on white paper, without exterior masrks. Wlhon his name is callod, the elector is to present his voting-paper closed; and tbe presi' dent is to deposit it in the baUot box. This box is to have two locks, the key of one of which is to be kept by the pro- sident, the other by the senior assessor. The vote of each elector ia to be recorded by the signatuire or mark of one CS thie members of the bureau in the margin of the list- The names of the electors wilO may not bave voted are to be called over. The ballot boxes are to be sealed up, and deposited durmng the night at the Mlairie, and be protected by a post of the National Guard or the army. The room con taimilng tLhes boxes is to be sealed up. The counting of the vots3 i3 thus to bo proceeded to :-the boxes are to be opened, and the number of votes to be verified. If this number be greater or less than that of the voters, the fact is to be mentioned in the minutes. The counting of the votes is to be made by the members of the bztreau The tabies on which this is to be done are to be ranged in such a way that electors may walk round them Blank voting papers, together with those in which it may be imnpossible to recognise either adhesion or refusal, are lnot to be counted, but are to be annexed to the minutes. Immediately after the counting of the votes, the reeult of the bulot to be published, and the voting papers, with the ex- ception of those annexed to the minutes, are to be burned in presence of the electors. In the communes divided into sec tions, the result of the votes, expressed in each section is to be settled and signed by the bureau, and afterwards be con i-eyed by the president to the bureau of tho first section. who is to mako the addition. The examination of votes for all the departrents are to be made by a commission of three ccuncilior-generaIs to be named by the Prefect.'\n\"\"\"\" The Minister of the Interior has addressed the following letter, dated the 7th, to the Commander. in-Chief of the National Guiards:-\n\"\"\"\"'Genera],-In E'voral parts of Paris some owners o' bouEei have shamelessly written on their doors \"\"\"\"Ar,ine\nckstns.\"\"\"\" One could conceive that a National Guard might wvrie \"\"\"\" A7n7 aSa rT ochs dcfcrce,\"\"\"\" in order to cover his re- ,ponsibility as regards the State and bis honour towards hi, feUow citizens, but to inscribs a mark of shame on the front of one's own house is revolting to the Prench chbaracter. I have given orders to the Prefect of Po'ice to cause these inscriptions to be effaced, and I request you to point out to rce the legions in which such things have taken place, in order that I may propose to the President of the Republic to decree their dissolution.'\n\"\"\"\"By decree of the President of the Republic, dated the 'tb, the 5th Legion of the National Guard is dissolved. The motive for this decree was the foUlowing letter to the Minister of the Interior from General Lowoestine\n\"\"\"\"'Monsieur le Ministre,-The National Guard will ap- plaud the sentiments expresed in the letter which you bave done me the honour to address to me. One of the legions of Paris has submitted to the double insult of being disarmed at the hou3es of its members, and the shameful inscriptions of which you speak. The Mairie, notwithstanding the presence of 60 men, was taken by the insurgents. This was the 5th legion. I communicate this fact to you, and call for its disolution. I am happy, on the other hand, to be in posses. mion of a great number of facts which show that the spirit of order and obedience has not ceased to reign in many other legions.'\n,fThe Moniteusr publishes a decree of the President of thie Republic, forming a commission, composed of the President of the Tribunal of Commerce of the Seine, the Mayors of the 2d, 6tb, and8th arrondisse- iments, M. Jay, architect of the city of Paris, and AI. Arnal, physician, to inquire Into and estimate\nIne iDjury received on the 3d, 4th, and 5th, by innocent victims of the insurrection. The same decree opens to the Minister of the Interior a credit of 200,000f. for the first necessities.\n\"\"\"\"The Cobnt;iltionnel says:-\n\"\"\"\"' We have already contradicted the false reports which were current as to the mnanner in which the representatives who were arrested d bden treated. At Vinoennee, in par-\nticular we leern that they were put into the old apartment3 of the Dule de Montpensier, and that General Courtigis treated them with eves) attention,'\n\"\"\"\"The COn4qitWionxe1 has the following -\n\"\"\"\"'A remarkable fct, and which is stated in all the re ports which hbae resched the authorities, in that the work- menhave talkn no part in the late inectios.

Bach\nconduct does honour to the mster, the overseer, and the worketen of that establishment.'\n\"\"\"\" The exact loss sustained by the army in the late eDgagements is now known. One superior officer and 15 soldiers were killed, and three officers and 104 soldiers wounded. Almost aU the latter haTe received most dangerous hurts, having been struck close at hand. This amount of loss is considered a heavy one, looking at the nature of the resistance.\n\"\"\"\"M. Pierre Leroy,Prefect of the Calvados,has been appointed Commissary-Extraordinary of the Govern- ment in the department or the Indre.\n\"\"\"\"The merchants of Rouen, says the Constetionnel\nhave not ceased, during the late events, sending orders to Paris. Some of them, in order to prevent the embarrassment of a commercial crisis, offer to settle their accounts in cash instead of paper. In the other parts of the Seine Inferieure and the sur- rounding departments commerce was no more dis- turbed than it was at Rouen.\n\"\"\"\"The C(ourrier ot Lyons says\nThe opinion wbich prevails in the mass of thetLyonese population, without distinction of classe, is generally one of more or less decided approbation of the act of vigour which has just been accomplished.'\n\"\"\"\" By decrees of the President of the Republic, bearing date the Gth, the following appointments have been made on the proposition of the MiniL ter of the Interior:-M. Maurice Duval is ap- pointed Commissary Extraordinary of the Go- vernment in the departments of the C6tes-du- Nord, the Finistere, Ille-et-Vilaine, Loire- Inf- rieure, Morbihan, Maine-et-Loire, La Vendee, and Ma3enne. M. Carlier, ex-Prefect of Police, has been appointed to a similar post in the depart- ments of the Allier, the Cher, and the Ni6vre, The following appointments of prefects have also taken place :-M. Beaumont-Fassy to the depart- ment of the Aisne, in place of M. Corbin; M. Pierre Leroy, secretary-gsnezal of the Minister of\nthe Interior, to the department of the Calvados, in: the place of M. Morisot ; M. G6rard de Villesaison, sub-prefect of Saint-Omer, prefect of the Baute-\nLoire, in the place of M. do Vidaillan; M. Cl6ment, I mayor of the 12th arrondissement of Paris, to the Orne, in the place of M. Paulze d'Ivoy ; M. Costa, formerly sub-prefect to the Tarn et Garonne, in' place of M. Pardeilhan-Mezin; M. de Tanlay, ex- prefect of the Manche, to the Somme, in place of M. MIasson; and M. Rogniat, formerly sub-prefect, to the Ain, in place of M. Chanal. The decree of November 26 is revoked, in what relate to the ap- pointment of M. do Tanlay to the prefecture of the Indre-et-Loire, M. Brun being maintained in his functions of prefect of that department.\n\"\"\"\" The last accounts received by the Minister of the Interior from the prefocts of department are favourable to the change which has recently taken place in the Government. The following principal towns are particularly mentioned as! en joying the most perfect tranquillity :-Marseilles,' Valence, Montpelier, Blois, Nismes, Lille, Chitteau- rous, Grenoble, Rouen, Strasburg, Colmar, St. Lo, Tulle, St. Etienne, Troyes, Bordeaux, Vend6me, Bayonne, Nantes, Toulouse, Bourges, &amp;c. The sub- joined accounts are from non-official sources:-\nAt Rheims, on the 4th, the Sub-Prefect received infor. I mation that a cozop de main, under cover of a pacific de- monstration, was to be made to seize the HOtel de Ville, in oreer to paralize the operations of General do Neuily, whoco arrival had been announced. The Sub Prefect immediately proceeded to the H6tel do Ville, and the Pro- cureur of tho Itepublic, the Commender of the National Guard, and the Central Commiseary of Police were summoned there. After conference with the Mayor, it was resolved that the Gendarmerie, headed by the Com- missary, should proceed to the Place St. Nicaise, in which incendiary proclamations were stuck up, and which was occupied by 200 men, in the midst of whom was a weli known ringleader named Bremsy. Extreme agitation prevailed in the groups, and the most s.laltning news were spread. At the sight of the gendarmerie there was a movement; but Bressy and some others were arrested without any resistance being offered. Documents of a compromising nature were ecized on them ; tho proclamations were torn down, and the crowd was dis- persed. The place was then occupied by a equadron of chas. seurs and part of the gendarmer.e, with six companies of the National Guard, aud a battalion of the 9th Regiment ranged themselves before the Hotel de Ville. In tho meantime a descent was mado by the police in the caf6s da ProgvOs and du Nouveau Monde, which are considered centres of perma nent agitation. After some arrests, which were not effected without resistance, and in the course of which one person menaced the Commissary with a sword, those establishments were clcsed. Patrols on a grand scale were orRanised, and in all quarters, especially in the Faubourg St. Rnmy, the population manifestly gave in its adhesion.\n'At Lille, about 8 o'clock in the evening of the 3d, a crowd assembled on tbe Grand Place, and a man with a long beard, brandishing a large cane, called out \"\"\"\" Iirc la 1lepub- iiqute!\"\"\"\" Some of the crowd added the word \"\"\"\" D'mocratiq?we,' at,d others \"\"\"\" Socialc.\"\"\"\" On this, a number of persons came in from adjacent streets, and joined the crowd. The singing\nof the JMla,ncillaisc then commenced. Disquietude having! been ceused by this demonstration, four commissarios of police, followed by police agents, presented themselves to\ndiseipato it. Resistance was offered, but they succeeded in!; soizing the most riotous. They were roughly assailed, and two of the commissaries, MM. Houze and Loieel, as weU aS soverat agents, were violently struck. But they succeeded in making five men prisoners, and in gettiog them lodged in the lock-up.\n\"\"\"\" 'About 1I0 demagogues of Moulins, armed to the teeth, assembled at a short distance from the town at midnight on the 3d, with the view of releasing their chiefs who were int\ncaicerated on the previous day. The authorities imme' diatoly eont a battdlion of light infantty to the spot. They advanced bileutly, but no sooner did they approach than the lcmnagogues took to flight. They met a second detacbment - finding themselves thus caught they displayed the greatest terror, and fled in all directions. Twelve of them were ar- rested. Muekets have been distributed to the National Guard, and it is proposed to organis8 moveable columns to pi eEerve order. A great number of citizens have already offered their services.\n\"\"\"\"' WVhen the news of the events reached Thiers (Pay de Dfme), tbo Reds assembled and invaded the Mairie. They were, however, soon expeUed by the gendarmerie ; and there- upon they proceeded to the adjacent vill-ges to call out their partisans. Meanwhile the firemen and the citizens devoted to order aesembled at the barriers, armed with fowling pieces. Intimidated at this demonstration, the demagogues deemed it prudent to retreat. A detachment of 200 men was subeequently sent from Clermont, and numerous arrests were made.\n\"\"\"\" ' At Roust,, in the night of the 4th, some few copico of a lithograpaed appeal to reistance were stuck up, but they were torn down, and the authors were subsequently arrested. Seven chiefs of the demagogues were aleo taken into custody. One of them, named Dupont, attempted resistance, but when the crowd were told that he was a Socialist they assisted the oflicer. Another, named Beanfour, had just returned from Paris, where he had bees to receive the mot LVordre of the secret societies.'\n\"\"\"\"The National Guards and the gendarmerie of BelleviUe, having M. Pommier, the Mayor, and M. Michaux, the Deputy-Mayor, at their head, con- ducted themselves with great energy and courage during the late insurrection. The Mayor received information at 4 o'clock, on Thursday, that some hundred demagogues had assembled at the Bar-. riere do la Courtille, and that they were be-\nginning to break open the shops and to plunder the houses for arms. The National Guards being apprised of the fact, hastened to the Mairie to pro- tect it from the insurgeRts. The 4th Company, which arrived the first, guarded the Mairie. An hour afterwards it was announced that the insurgents had raised a barricade. M. Michaux advanced against the insurgents at the head of the gendarmerie, and followed by the 4th company of the National Guards. The barricade was quickly carried. The insurgents fled, or were made prisoners. All the wine shops were then cleared, and tranquillity wsu restored. M. Pommier, the Mayor of Bellevile, with the 6th and 8th oompanies of the National Guards, pursued and dispersed the anarchists in every direction.\n\"\"\"\" You may remember that, amongst other great towns announced as in a state of insurrection simul- taneously with Paris, was Amiens. I have seen a letter from that city, dated yesterday; it is to this effect:-\nW 'e hav receivd tb, news of the Inurrection in Patis.\nAmiens Is profoundly tranquil-as tranquil as our hearts can desire. The act of the President ha. given us all the greatest tatisfaction, witb, perhaps, the exception of the vote en comica; but he haa taken an Immense weight off our heart#.'\n\"\"\"\" The Mayor, deputy-mayors, and members of the Municipal Council of the Batignolles have pre- sented the following address to the President of the Republic: -\n\"\"\"\" ' Monsieur le Pr6pident,-We think that we perform an act of patriotism in coming to offer to you our thanks for the immense service which you have rendered to the whole of so. ciety by saving it from narchy and from civil war. We believe that it is the means of consolidating confidence which was reviving and promptly restoring public prosperity You may, theretore, rely on our co-operation in the maintenance of public order. Our population has generally applauded the great act which you have accomplisbed, and its gocd sense guarsntees us that public tranquillity will be no rnore diturbed.'\n\"\"\"\" The Prefect of the department of the Nord has just published the following proclamation:-\n&lt; I Inhabitants of the department of the Nord -France society, and civilisation have triumphed. The enemi's of our homed, of our families, of our present and our futuro are vanquished. The elect of the nation accomplishes b s providential mission for the happiness of France and of Europe. Electrified by the name of Louis Napolcon Bon - parte, and confident in him word and in bis devotedness, o,r admirable army has crushed anarby. There can be but one sentiment in the heart of honest men, that of gratitude towards Louis Napoleon Bonaparto; lotus rally round him, and return thanks to Providence, which has chosen him to save us. Inhabitants of the department of the Nord, you have had confidence in the Government and in the Prefect wrho represnts it in the midst of you. I thank you for your patriotic co-operation. \"\"\"\" I BESSON.'\n\"\"\"\" The Council-General of the department of the Indre-et-Loire, on receiving the news of the Presi- den''s appeal to the people, assembled spontaneously, and voted an address of congratulation to him.\n\"\"\"\"The ex-representatives of tho Mountain, Car. boneau, of the Gers; Ceyras (Oorreze), Chabert (Ard6che), Chavassieu (Loire), Gavarret (Gers), Gambon (Nievre), Guiter (Pyren6es Orientales), Perdiquier (Seine), Richardet (Jura), have becn arrested during the night.\n\"\"\"\"We find the following in the Pat e:\n\"\"\"\"' The President of the Republic having heard that hl. Thiers was ill in the prison of Mazas, and that ho could not receive proper attention there, has ordered him to be remove I to bis own home, and there placed under the surveillance of the police. M. Thiers was therefore set at liberty, and returned thiE evening to his hoteL M.

Louis Blanc has beon arresteol as he was leaving a steamer, and about to take the railway.'\n\"\"\"\" On Saturday, the President of the Republic sent Captain de Toulongcon, one of his orderly officers, to visit the various ambulances, and to carry from him the expressicn of his condolence and the offer of his aid to the wounded. Yesterday, Lieut.- Colonel de Beville, another orderly officer, went to the hospitals on a similar mission.\n\"\"\"\" Yesterday morning, General Magnan, the Com- mander-in-Chief of the garrison of Paris, visited the military hospital of the Val de Grace. TIe General entered the different wards, and spoke in the kindest manner to the wounded mop, promising them the notice and protection of tle President of the Republic. Before he left the hospital, he thanked the medical men attached lo the establishment for their attention to the men under their care. From the Val de Grlece the General proceeded to the Hotel Dieu, and afterwards to the other hospitals and amblances where wounded soldiers were lying. Through the whole of his route he was received with loud acclamations.\n\"\"\"\" The Prefect of Police addressed, on Saturday, the following circular to the commissaries of police of Paris:-\n\"\"\"\"'The dencute is suppressed. Our enemies are henceforth powerless to raise barricades. Novertholess, the excite. ment to revolt continues. Ardent demogogues mix with the groups to excite to agitation and circulate false news. The 'Montagnard ex-ropresentatives turn to account the la.t remnants of their old prestige to lead the people with them. Furnished lodging-houses, caf`6, and suspected house3 become the receptacle of conspirators and insurgents. Arms, ammunition, and incendiary writings are concealed there. All the causes of agitation must be suppreesed by practising on a large scale a system of search and arrests. It is the means of restoring to the capital that peace and tranquillity wbich a handful of factious men have sought to tako from it. You bave all dono your duty with so much devotednes3 and courage that I doubt not but that, in order to fulfil this new and important mi,sion, you will display all the vigilance and energy which are called for by circumstances.\n\"\"\"\" ' DE MAUPAS.\n\"\"\"\"All the small posts which were withdrawn at the commencement of the insurrection, to pre- vent the men from being surprised and deprived of their arms, have been replaced. This shows that the Government feels perfectly confident as to the maintenance of the tranquillity that has been re-established. In the nights of Saturday andyesterday strong patrols of cavalry and ini- fantry however, paraded many of the streets. Nearly all the shops in different parts of tne town were re-opened on Saturday. At most f the theatres there were performances ; last night they were all open. All the law courts he!d sittings on Saturday as usual. The gardens of the Tuileries and of the Palais Royal, and tle court-yard of the Louvre, have agaia n een thrown opea to the public. For the last three days all the principal scenes of the insurrection, and especially the Boulevards, have been visited by large crowds of curious; at some moments the Boulevards *vere sO thronged with pedestriaus and vehicles that it was not easy to obtain a passage.\n\"\"\"\" M.

NA | 23645 | NA | June 13, 1860    | A Royal conqueror once said that, if he wero King of France, not a gun should be fired in Europe without his consent. The meaning of the speech swas that the Sovereign of a country so populous, so compact, and so advantageously placed might, by zhe mere threat of his intervention, impose peace upon all Continental Powers. in substance the doctrine was sound, and we sce its truth expressed by a strange application at the present day. The Emperor of the FRENCnv is in a position to declare. +.hat without his consent not a sword shall remain in its scabbard. He is the arbiter of European peace\nor wvar. When France arms all other nations arm; I vhen she disarms herself other Powers will follow her example. It is a high prerogative, and doubtless gratifying to the national temperament, but we\n-wish it may be exercised in a pacific rather than al 'warlike spirit. \"\"\"\"The Empire\"\"\"\" could reaUly have' been \"\"\"\"peace\"\"\"\" if Louis NAPOLEox had so wvilled it. At this moment the Governmuent of France is engaged in prosecuting the author of a pamtphlet who charged it with incessant meddling, and it must be presumed, therefore, to disclaim a policy of interven- fion and disturbance; but its acts tell, unfortunately, in an opposite direction. What \"\"\"\"question\"\"\"\" is to\nfollow the \"\"\"\" Italian question,' wliat \"\"\"\" idea\"\"\"\" is to I -succeed that of 1859, we caunot predict; but it is! evident that no tranquillity is expected. ThIe\nFrench themselves are as much impressed with the i fact as other people. Their political sky is never clear. They are always on the look-out for a tem- pest, and the Imperial solicitude is v ainly expended in the encouragement of that commerce which will never thrive but in peace.\nWVhy, let us ask, should it cause auy commotion if an interview is contemplated between the Prince Rlegent of PrassiA and the Emperor of the FrrNscu ? Such a meeting, we are assured, is likely to take place at Baden Baden -within a few days, but why should it create any uieasintess or suggest alarm for the settlement of Europe ? Crowned heads have often met, and visits have been interchangted between the ExTrexor aud Queen VTwrosnA. Why, then, should this in- ,erview fill statesmen w-ith speculations and Cabinets with conjectures? The explanation is so notorious that it would be mere afiectation to dissemble the truth. People fear that it imports some new disturbance; that it is tho first act in a new Emropean drama; that Prussia will be sounded about the Rhenish provinces as S.ardinia was sounded about Savoy; that the temptation of cqluivalents may be again forthcoming, and that possibly some fresh annexation may ultimately follow a fresh con- ference and a fresh campaibrn. That is the current talk. Those are the apprehensions now coimmonly prevailing, and who can say they are unwarrant- able ? If we could but assume, which ve are neither entitled nor disposed to do, that Prassia is ns amenable to management as Sardinia was, no might forecast the future with almost as muic'L contidence as we foretell a stormi from the indica- tions of a barometer, and carry two courses of e3vents in two parallel lines from B3aden laden and Plombic?res. France wants her \"\"\"\"natural\"\"\"\" fron- tiers-the Alps amid the rvhine. Savoy has taken her to the Alps,-what is to take her to the Rhiiie ? One transacticn has been closed, is the other to open ?\nAll this is closely in accordance with thc tradi- tions of the First Empire, and of that reign which LOUIS NAAPoLEON naturally regards with admira- tion aud affection. For some ten or twelve years a:t the commencement of the century there was a continual redistribution of European territory, and the licence taken by the First ; NArOLEoX in these niatters was most extravagant. Very recently, too, the historian of those times, MI. THIEnS, has reverted to some of the ideas of the period. In lhis last volume of the Cons\"\"\"\"l.ate ranl tilc Enpire, not once, but repeatedly, and as if expressing an in- contestablo trutbh, o speaks of the Phino and the Alps as the \"\"\"\"natural frontiers\"\"\"\" of France, and directly contrasts those limits, not only with the boundaries imposed in 1815, but witlh the frontiers existing before the wars of the Revolution began. It does not occur to him to reflect that if the Alps and the Rhine are the \"\"\"\" natural\"\"\"\" frontiers of France, nature has never yet prevailed in the arrangement of those frontiers, for there never -was a time, save during the brief convulsions of a revolution, when the French monarchy was tihs bounded. Those, however, are his expres- sions, and they point so clearly to a French \"\"\"\"ideiV' that nobody can mistake their pturport. 'We are ,old that France is now strong, and that she is justified In protesting against the Treaties of iSL;, imposed upon her whon she was weak. But the destruction of those Treaties would not give her her \"\"\"\" natural\"\"\"\" frontiers. She did not possess those frontiers in 14 90, nor at any former period of her history.\nIn promoting his policy, whatever it may be, by personal interviews Louis XAroLEo.N treads closely in the footsteps of his uncle. lie is pro-\n. by a believer in his own powers of persuasion, anid he fully appreciates the other advantages of direct and confidential negotiation. The pre- cedents, however, are not really encouraging either for one side or the other. Xone of the old bar- gains bore any good fruit, and, if The suspicions of Europe on the present occasion rest on any sound foundation, the prospect is a bad one. The French Empire can be consolidated and extended in a far better fashion than this. More was lost than gained by the annexation of Savoy and l!ce. That proceeding was the first cause of the unpopularity of the French Treaty in this country. We might have put up wNith a little dis- advantage in the terms of the bargain, and looked with iudulgence on Protectionist delusions, which, for that matter, we had not long discarded ourselves. WVhat unsettled our views was the discovery that, though France could make a Commercial Treaty with England, she could, at the same time, make treaties quite uncommercial with other States, and that, while she kept 600,000 soldiers in arms, she wvas ready to go to war for an \"\"\"\"idea.\"\"\"\"\nIt is not in any spirit of national jealousy that such feelings are entertained on this side of the Chlanel. WVe do not consider that in any balance of power the strength of France is materially increased by the acquisition of Savoy. WVe should not even much concern onrselves if such increase of strength had actually accrued. WVe know very well that, as far as the power of nations goes, France is far more likely to gain by cultivating the arts of peace than by trying the chances of war. She would be stronger after five yea:s of peaca and disarmament than after ten years of even successful campaigns. iL TamRs, in the volume w-e have already quoted, draws an impressive picture of the condition to which his country had been reduced by those \"\"\"\" vie- \"\"\"\" tories and conquests,\"\"\"\" to which Frenchmen still turn with exultation and pride. The end of all these triumphs was, that even before a single battalion of the Allies had crossed the Rhine France tvas in a state of ruin. The resources of the late dominant and conquering 3Empire were so exhausted that muskets could not be found for the troops levied in haste against the invaders, and such, but for the incomparable genius of the EzrEisoin, was the defenceless position of the nation, that the Allies, if they could have suspected so astounding a truth, might have marched to Paris without a halt at the French frontier. All this was the fruit of war ; and it shows how truly the interests of Franice, no Icss than those of Europe, require that the Second Empire should indeed be based upon peace.

  | A Royal conqueror once said that, if he were | 85.69 | 0FFO-1860-JUN13-009-001 |\n| NA | 20003 | NA | October 25, 1848 | It has been resolved to Bpare the lives of the con- vioted Irish rebels. This announcement, though Teally important, and calculated to raise some very grave questions, will be received as a matter of course by the public, so entirely has it been anticipated, from the date of the rebellion itself, not to say earlier. For oue reason or another no one was prepared to see SMirTH O'BRnrm dying the death of a malefactor. The scaffold was either too ignominious, too dignified, or too grave for so silly and contemptible an offender. Ire is not an assassin, Eike THisTLEWOOD; he iS not a murderer, lke GQEENrACRE; he is not a patriot, lke WALLACE; but simply a spoilt child who, partlyfrom pique, partly from imitation, chose to play at the gamte of rebellion. Vanity pointed out the only. pouible line in which-S&amp;fr O'BRIEN could hope to be distinguished. Without habits of business, with- out genius, without cotmmon sense, and, above all, without temper, lie courted a people who would not trust him, a clergy who betrayed him, a party which would neither obey him nor manage itself-all in the vain expectation that he would step into the seat of O'CONNELL, and pass thence, perhaps, to the presidency of a republic, if not the traditionary throne of his ancestors. We have seen in this country and in the Senate, that he made himself the jeat of the zation by his peevish and pointless obstinacy. We say it with aU seriousness, that the soleow execution of such a crack-brained mounte- bank would have shocked the national sentiment as much as if the dread ceremonial were performed on a monkey, or a fifth-formschoolboy. We say this of OWB=rN, but really the same applies to all. Their rebellion has been only a Christmas mummery a little out of season.\nWe are not underrating the dangerous eharaoter of the crime,or the amount of mischief which these men might have done. The farce might have turned into a tragedy, and an ocean of blooi might easily have beer shed to satisfy the humour of a few eily boys. There are many things, however, to be taken into ac- count in dealing with crime. The venaltv is not\nmerely according to the mischief. It has respect, also, to the capacity of the author. Ever the tounsel-for. the defence has told the jury, that the prisoners did not know what they were saying ir doing. In the case of EIAGiiER, especially, the jury were entreated to suppose that this lo- quacious and headstrong stripling, had learned X heap of common places about tyranny, patriotism, republicanism, and so forth, and then, in the casual excitement of the crisis, had poured forth a set of senseless philippics in the fdlseto tone of a debating society,or intheunconsciousness of amesmeric france. The jury very properly declined to make themselves responsible for a plea which would have given aU the madcaps and fools in the empire special licence to rebel. As long as the plea of idiotcy was not expressly urged, it was necessary to treat the pri- soners as sane. The punishimient, however, is another question, and one which admits of more considera- tions. Among those considerations ideas of fitness come in, and every body feels that wholesome discipline at Bermuda, of home other safe retire- ments, would suit Mr. MEAGUER!S complaint muich better than the gaRlows.\nIn making these remarks on this particular case, and this knot of delinquents, we are not com- mitting ourselves to the question of capital punishment for, political crimes, On the con- trary, we feel that a vast quantity of twaddle has been talked on this serious subject. We fear that [the blood of innocent myriads will still flew through a foolish scruplosity for the life of the rebel. If anybody deserves death on the scaffold, it is the man who arrays citizen against citizen who stains the homnely pavement with the blood of peaceful men, who opens endless qirels, andthrows- the State into confusion,merely because'hehas X fancy for some theory. of government which has never been tried, or because;, ot being: satisfied with his place in. te existing system, he hopes to better him- sell in a scramble. Such men are generally political gamblere, Tiaey are eo imbued with the spirit of\n'chance, and co apt to pTay double or quits&amp;ii comMon Affairs, that they;' look to a street 'fig4t- with mote relish than horror,' trusting.that they will not be in tho trif9ing per centage whom thb random bullets maim or kilL What terror thes, is there for such minds? The scaffold. Its tedious preliminaries, 'the trial, the sus- pense, the verdict, the condemned cell, the final Ieave-takikg, the priest, the passing bell, the grim and bratal executioner, the detestable ap- paratus, the rope or the knife, the basket, the coffin, the prison-yard grave, the place in the felon's calendar, the obloquy,-all these are things that tell even upon men ready any day to throw the dizzy die of revolution or the grave. The induigence of a wan- ton and selfish ambition, at the certain cost of both guilty and innocent blood, is murder and something more. They who are guilty of such crimes deserve an ignominious death. When justice speaks unequi- vocally nothing should be allowed to contravene her decision, except a clear case for mercy or prudence. It may be a wise mercy, or a merciful prudence, to mitigate the punishment. But to forgive desperate, hard-headed, and hard-hearted offenders, who have long meditated the crime, and who are certain to re- peat iton the first opportunity, is neither mercy nor prudence. Justice it certa,ily is not., Let not the doom of the murderer be tlpught too'much for the crime, or too bae for ther'iik:of sulch men. We wish that one. rebel should die rather than ten thousand men should follow his example, and, pos- sibly, perish in his stead.\nIt is childish and false to argue that the Govern- Iment of this country is itself founded on revolution; and that treason is only an ill name for resistance, and rebellion for defeat. No mere rebellion has ever permanently succeeded in* this country. The great Revolution of 1688, on which the, present dynasty and overnment stand, was not a resiat- ance to law and authority. It was. the lawful\neistaiie-of the people to the rebellion:of the KING. The Xq was the traitor, and was punished ac- vAihigly-. 'The law of this country defined his'au- thokiy and duties as clearly as it did those of his *tiZjedts. He?set to work establishing a system beside ta'''bove the laws. I he was broughtc to no regular t;ribua, if his punishment was devised with secrecy and effectediforce,that was. simply because the nature of the case allowed no other method of pro- ceeding,inor had the constitution supposed the case of an enemy in the person of the King. But no historical precedents can avail to prove that rebel- lion is not a crime. If it is guiltless, then\nwnat is to iimcer men trom continual re- bellion, and why are we not' to live in a perpetual struggle for change and scramble for power? Why not make a hell upon earth in the sacred name of liberty? The law under which we live is our judge in these matters. Ther4e is no appeal from it. They who violate it do so, at their peril. The only merit of rebellion is that it is a personal risk, and nothing can be so mean and ridiculous as a wish to risk the country and secure one- self. On whom properly fall the risks of a re- belLion ? The rebel or the loyal man? We may have.a, certain respect forthe man who, from astrong sense of oppresson, comes forward to resist the law with a balter iound his i&amp;ek.. -hat hater-goes some way to consecrate his cause. We cannot find this redeeming circumstance in the Irish rebellion. For a variety of reasons it was felt,by all,-by none more than the leadera themselves,y-that their own necks were insured, and that if the worst should come to the worst, Government would be merciful to those whom it would no longer fear.\nThe prospect of a mitigated and very mila punish- ment has grown into such a certainty in the course of the trials, as to impart a mock heroic air to the speeches of the prisoners before snteuce.. Waen a man has nothing more terrible in contemu life than a tranquil' and perhaps studious fife in a genial climate, without the. labour and aixiety inseparable frola an honest and. useful career, he can talk very' gracefully 4nd com- fortably of the scaffold and the judgment,-oof his country, his judges, and the other personages of the drama in which he is a.ting. It was our painful duty for months to record and to comment upon the false- hoods, the calumnies, the incentives to hatred, and the instigations to massacre which Mr. T. MEA&amp;GHEt freely cast like burning brands on the explosive medium of the Irish temper. We see no truth or piety in a solemn\nreference of such villanous trash to the judge- ment-seat of the ALMIG=; but we ee a good deal of hypocrisy in such an act when to aU appearance the speaker is not so near that judgment- seat as he was six months ago, when surrounded by his dupes and flattered witlx the hopes of a Gabo- Irish Republic.

It deserves;and -will repay an attentive perusal:-\nPosen, MfarcuS .\n3My dear,-Since I wrote last we bave iffered much and severely, And are- still mncertain what may await us. You have probably Iearned from the public papers that our anxious anticipations of a revolution were continuilly ang- menting. The Goeernment was as much awake to the zymptoms as ourselres, and at three different periods innumerable arrests have tal-en place, each serving to exasperate yet more the youthful portion of our population, who believed that their turn to revolt was- come, for more thanl15years cannot pass without a newgeneration'srenewing the attempts in which their parents have hitherto failed. Our youth have been always the first to rise, and now, more tlhan ever, it has been the very young who have insisted on making tho attempt. In rain the rational refused to take part, with them, saying, \"\"\"\"It is impossible-this is not the moment-let us wait,\"\"\"\"-tkey could not understand thia language, aiid their plans were arranged, extending to every part of ancient Poland: it is even said (and it ia the enemy who say it) that their measures were well concerted. But the Russian police got scent of these plans, and revealed the whole to the Prussian Government, in consequence of which, such enormous numbers were arrested that no snovement) took place here. But it had been arranged that the revolution should commezce everywhere on the same day-at Cracow, where the Government had not been forewarned as it was here, the Austrians on duty in the town were driven out-everything was done In the most admirable order, and with extreme mildness. Except- ing that the Russian and Austrian.eagles were broken and trampled in the dirt, no kind of Tiolence was committed, nor any.spirit of revenge shown, though God knows, the pro- vocation of long years of oppression was not wanting. Those who desired to leave Cracow were at liberty to do so, ana a guard even was given to the Prussian Consul who remained in the town. The previsions government'was fornmed of respectable and moderate persons, and. not a drop of blood was shed, for the Austrians, as usual, fled as soon as they perceived the probability of danger.\nInGaliciathingshave takenamostmelancholyturn. During the 50 years that Gallicia has belonged to the Austrians, they have done all in their power to persuade the people that it had always formed a part of Austria-that Poland had obtained possession of it for some years, and that those years had been very unhappy for the country-that the Poles were their enemies and always treated them as a conquered people, and that since Austria had repossessed herself of Gallicia, the inhabitants were far more happy, and ought to bless their adorable Sovereign and his Go-vern. ment. You, who have so long resided there, know how adorable theyare, and how happy the people; but it is not difficult to persuade those who have no means of knowing better, that things aremuch werse eisewhere. On the other hand, during the last ten years, communist emissaries from Prance havebeen working on this poor people, promising them a revolution iRn which they should first get rid of the nobles, and then share their lands and riches among themselves. There two influences, though emanating from different prin- ciples, tended to the same result-that of setting tho pea- sants against the proprietors. lVhen the revolution of Cra- cow broke out, the GoverDment in Gallicia took the alarm, and formed.guards of safety, composed of the peasants, to whom arms were given, and on the first indication of re- velt (some horses being taken by force from a post-master), a reward oftl florins good money (equivalent to 11. sterling), was promised for every insurgent, living or dead, who should be given up to the Austrian authorities. The spies and agents of the Austrian Government then played their part, intoxicating the peasauts, in order to produce in them the proper degree of excitement, and thus inducing them to massacre some, individuals who attempted to defend them. selves. The promised reward for these bodies having been paid, and the pilage of their houses tolerated, the peasants attacked all they met, in the streets, on the public roads, and even in the houses, and a horrible massacre took place.\nThe troops of the republic of Cracow had repaired to Gal- licia, intending to join the revolution which was to have begun simultaneously with that of Cracow ; but they were met by Austrian regiments far more numerous than them- selves, and receiving no aid from the inhabitants, who had been already massacred, they were defeated and mostly cut to pieces by the excited peasants, the Austrian authorities continuing to pay for every dead bedy brought in, and the Austrian troops looking on, without endeavouring to prevent any of these horrors. I feel, while writing these details, that you wil have difficulty in be- lieving them, and that these to whom they are related must suppose them to be exaggerated, but ray husbahd has just arrived fromn Gailicia, having performed a part of the journey in company with the Vice-President of that province (indeed, it would have beon impossible at that moment to haTe travelled otherwise), and the Vice-President told him that in the whole circle of Tarnow there were not more than three or four proprietors who had escaped the massacre. You mayimagine in what a state we have been. lYhen my husband arrived here, advantage vwas taken of his name to spread the report that he had returned from Galicia, where he had been to commence the revolution, that it had broken out everywhere, that it was quite time to begin it here, aitd that it was disgraeeful that the Government should have so easily succeeded in suppressing it at Posen. Many poor dupes believed this, and an attempted attack on Posen was the consequence; but having neither chief nor plan, and with many spies among theit number, they naturally failed, some were kiled, many arrested, and among them several people in the employ of my husband, which led to the belief that he was concerned in it. Here then was fresh cause for anxiety-a prison awaited him, and for some days we were every moment expecting him to be arrested; this, however, tormented me less than the rest, for, as he positively had nothing to do with it, I had no doubt the truth would soon be evident, and it appears that it is so, for he has not been molested.\nThe students of the college here being suspected, orders were given to four of the masters to visit their homes, and search for arms and other proofs. This, vwhich is the busi. nese of the agents of police, the masters very properly re- fused to do, therefore the college has been closed, it is said for six weeks, but some think altogether. A second college at Tzemaszno is also closed, because suspicions have been awakened as to the fidelity of the pupils to the principles there iRculcated. This is a great calamity. The Govern. ment is now pursuing a sstem of petty prosecutions, with demnonstrations of hatred and revenge towards the entire province, and even towards individuals in no ;way connected with the late movements, which appear to me very dange- rous and ill-advised, for they tend to exasperate those who are most disposed to remain quiet. It is said, that the people in the kingdom (Russian Poland) are beginning to rise; but we have no poitive news, allare intercepted. God knows how it will end. You may conceive that, in such a state of things it ig difficult to find time for letter-writing. Our habitual occupations are not dminiahed; many new duties added; and, as you may muppom, our condition, both soul and body, is deplorable.\nThe children do write, but-sometimes their young imagina-\ntions lead them .to represent things in a manner that makes it impossble to seid their letter3, the impresions of the moment (often terrible) inducing them to form judgments which I should be sorry to transmit to England. Sometimes their letters are not of a nature to be sent to the post, and the difficulties I make about sending their letters dis- courage them from writing. Some have only waited a word of explanation from me, which I have not found a moment to add, and others have been despatched, but r per- ceive have never reached you.\nDo not be uneasy about our persona-nothing will happen tothem. The tomn is fortified and guarded by such an immense number of troops, that it would be madness to attack it. The failure of the first attempt has discouraged the most enterprUiing. If further efrorts are madq, it will be anywhere ratter than Posen, so that we are exposed to no risk; but as to bur poor country-entreat of God to have pity on us, for we are very wretched. We have this moiaeat read in the Giazdte of Warsaw, that the Russians have ont to Oracow their most barbarous troops, Cossacks, Mmul- mans, .and Circauians to exterminate the insurgents, In Gali&lt;a, the peasants will scareely have completed tbeir massaces, wben'they will in their turn be punished by deatih for iihat they aro now paid to do. We aro most unfortu- natel Our Governments say openly, \"\"\"\" Fe thought we had crushed -you long ago, but since you still live, ve will soon fnd means to exterminate ye o!\"\"\"\"\nwhat can I aad to this sad letter ?-hat, tbank God, we still live? it is even difficult to say, thank God, while we live only to witness such honors.

A week since the throne of the Grand Duke seemed no more insecure than that of most Italian Potentates in times of popular com- motion; for the last few days, however, the ex- citement has been gradually rising among all classes burning to know the course the Grand Duke in- tended to pursue in the now inevitable struggle. The procrastination of the Court has vastly increased this feeling, and though a week since a declaration of neutrality might possibly have checked for the mo- ment the passions of the people, it was felt through- out yesterday that nothing short of an immediate decision in favour of Piedmont could prevent a popular demonstration, which could have but one issue. General Ferrari the head of the Tuscan forces, yesterday sent in his resignation, while bands of soldiers and citizens paraded the streets, singing patriotic songs and mingling the names of VictorEmmauuelaudItalianindependence. Through- out the day emisaries of the National party might be seen posting up addresses to the citizens in the most public manner, urging them to throw off the yoke of Austria, and rise in behalf of Italian independence. At an eArly hour this morning, the people (to the number\nof 20,000) asembled in the Piazza Santa Maria Antonia. Hlere the tricolour of Italy was raised, amid rapturous acclamations, and bands of men of all classes, soldiers and citizens, dispersed them- selves in every direction ; each troop led by a bearer of the national standard. In less than an hour the tricolour was floating over the tower of the Palazzo Vecchio and the fortresses of S. Giorgio and S. Giovanni. The greater portion of the assembly proceeded at once to the Palace of the French M{[}inister, who thanked the people for their sympathies with the Emperor and France. They then proceeded to the Sardinian Ambassdors. Amid a thousand vivas and the waving of binners he pre- sented himself to the people; reminded them that the eyes of Italy and Piedmont were upon them; exhorted them to respect religion, law, and pro- perty; recommended discipline to the army, quiet and order to all. \"\"\"\" The moment will come,\"\"\"\" he ex- claimed, \"\"\"\"nay, isnowat hand,whenyouwill be called upon to employ your arms in defence of your country He next announced that the Grand Duke had de- clared his intention of abandoning Tuscany, de- manded in the name of Victor Emmanuel and the national honour, that respact should be paid to his peason, and trusted that the citizens would obey the Government that would be organized to meet the present emergency. He then disclaimed on the part of Sardinia any intention of interfering in the affairs of Tuscany, farther than to provide for the public tranquillity and the exigencies of war. The object for which Piedmont drcw the sword was inde. pendence, not ambition. Let them all rememberthat\nliberty was only acquired by great sacrificesby acts of virtue and entire obedience. Under these circiumL stances the Grand Duke, at an early hour, called upon Don Neri Corsini, Marquis of Lajatico, to aid hia counsels. On his declaring that abdication in favour of his son was the only course that could save the succession, the Grand Duke summoned the corps diploraatique and declared that he preferred quitting the country to condescending to this step. Before the public announcement of tnis the scene before the Palazzo Pitti was most exciting. The very guards and servants of the Grand Duke had mounted the tricolour, while thousands were moving to and fro across the grand piazza. The most im- portant fact was the perfect command which the leaders of the people seemed to possess over each and all. They might be seen going from group to group recommending order i Il tranquillity. Throughout the entire day no single\\&ct of turbu- lence occurred, as far as I have been able to dig- cover. The cause of this can only be found in the entire unanimity of the people in their hatred of Austria, which so far from being confined to Lombardy and Piedmont is universal through- out the Peninsula. Before 4 in the after- noon it was known that the Grand Duke would quit Tuscany with all his family rather than abdi- cate in favour of the Hereditary Archduke. An address was immediately issued to the people, de. claring that Leopold II., though his opinions coin- cided with those of Tuscany, was on the point of abandoning his country a second time, with al his family. In order to avoid allowing the country to run the risk of a state of anarchy, a Junto was in process of formation, which 'without wishing in any way to influence the future, would undertake to maintain order and give up its authority at the earliest Dossible moment. In the meantime, the wishes of the army of Tuscany would be satisfied, and the Dictatorship of Tuscany offered to Victor Emmanuel during the war. ,\nGeneral Uloa (it continued) the illustrious de- fender of Venic e, was already on his way to Florence,\nsent by the King of Piedmont. The Tuscan army would be proud to find him at its head. After an ex- hortstion to order, the first and most solemn act of patriotism, the address wound up with the state- ment that the names of the provisional Government would be given at the earliest moment.\nAt S the Gruan Duke, with his family and a band of officers (to see him safely to the froatier), left Florence by the Porta Romano, and, crossing the iron bridge above the city, made the circuit of the walls, and followed the road to Bologna from the Porta San Gallo. At 11 o'clock the most perfect tranquillity reigned throughout the city.\nAPRrL 28.\nAt an early hour this morning the foltowing pro- clamation appeared:-\n\"\"\"\" The Grand Dake and his Government, sooner than satisfy the just demands of the country manifested in so many ways and for so long a time, have abandoned it to it- self. At this crisis the municipality of Florence, the only element of authority that still exists, wishing to meet the emergency of Tuscany left withorLt a Government, have nominated the undermentioned to act provisionally.\n\"\"\"\"Ca.

This rumour was denied by the Consfifutionnel and the Patie, but without much effect, in consequence, perhaps, of the support given by those journals to the policy of the President of the Republic. A cor- respondence has, however, been published which must set the question at rest: the contradiction given to it by Count d'Argout, the Governor of the Bank, is, at all events, entitled to some respect. It is as follows:-\n\"\"\"\" 'Monsieur is Gouverneur,-It has been rumoured that on tho occasion of late events, 1, as Minister of Finance withdrew from the Bank a sum of 25,0G0,000f. You know that this rumoar bas no foundation, that I confined myself in my despatch of the 27th November to making known to you the intention of the Goveranmett to dispose of that sum, in virtue of the treaty of the 30:h June, 1848, and that I left the Ministry without having withdrawn the 25,000,000, which I wished to keep in reserve for the public Eexvice.

On no point of the territory bave secret societies been orga- nized with more union and audacity. They propagat, everywhere the most subversive doctrines, and prepare in sume sort the eventualities of an insurrection. It is impor- tant, therefore, to tranquillize honest men,who are oppressed and menaced with impunity by a minority of agitators. With this view, I have the honour to submit to your sanction a decree, declaring the deparlmonts of the H6rault and the t;ard in a state of siege.'\n\"\"\"\" The above report is followed in the Monitour bXy a decree of the President of the same date, de claring these two departments in a state of siege.\n\"\"\"\" The Minister of the Interior has sent a circular to the prefects of departments, containing in- structions relative to the taking of votes in the tsppeal to the people. The following are the prin- cspal points:-\n'The votes are to be taken on the 20th and 21st inst. The electors are to be the persons who would be entitled to vote in virtue of the Electoral Law of the 1:5th March, 1849 -tbat is to say, all thoeo not labouring under coetain speci. tied diequalifications, who are 21 years of age, and have re. sided six months at least in a commnune. The lists are to bo published at the latest on tho 16th, and are to be definitivelv closed on the 19th. Citizens whose narnes are omitted may call ou the mayors or hJues de e)aLv to insert thom. The votirz is to be continued each day from 8 O'clock to 4. Whs,e thie population is too large to vote entirely in one place, sections may be established. The presidency of the bureau of the voting places is to bo occupied by mayors, deputy-mayors, and munioipal councillore, or ia their ab. sence by persons delegated by iuges de paiar. Each bureau is to consist of a president, four assessors, and a secretary chosen by them from amongst the electors. The asaessors are to be taken from amongst the municipal councillora in the order of inscription, unless tho je'ges de psa; shall have directly proceeded to designate them. Electors are to bring their voting papers ready prepared. They are to contain the word Yes or No, as an answer to the proposition submitted to the people by the President of the Republic They enay be printed or written, and are to be on white paper, without exterior masrks. Wlhon his name is callod, the elector is to present his voting-paper closed; and tbe presi' dent is to deposit it in the baUot box. This box is to have two locks, the key of one of which is to be kept by the pro- sident, the other by the senior assessor. The vote of each elector ia to be recorded by the signatuire or mark of one CS thie members of the bureau in the margin of the list- The names of the electors wilO may not bave voted are to be called over. The ballot boxes are to be sealed up, and deposited durmng the night at the Mlairie, and be protected by a post of the National Guard or the army. The room con taimilng tLhes boxes is to be sealed up. The counting of the vots3 i3 thus to bo proceeded to :-the boxes are to be opened, and the number of votes to be verified. If this number be greater or less than that of the voters, the fact is to be mentioned in the minutes. The counting of the votes is to be made by the members of the bztreau The tabies on which this is to be done are to be ranged in such a way that electors may walk round them Blank voting papers, together with those in which it may be imnpossible to recognise either adhesion or refusal, are lnot to be counted, but are to be annexed to the minutes. Immediately after the counting of the votes, the reeult of the bulot to be published, and the voting papers, with the ex- ception of those annexed to the minutes, are to be burned in presence of the electors. In the communes divided into sec tions, the result of the votes, expressed in each section is to be settled and signed by the bureau, and afterwards be con i-eyed by the president to the bureau of tho first section. who is to mako the addition. The examination of votes for all the departrents are to be made by a commission of three ccuncilior-generaIs to be named by the Prefect.'\n\"\"\"\" The Minister of the Interior has addressed the following letter, dated the 7th, to the Commander. in-Chief of the National Guiards:-\n\"\"\"\"'Genera{]},-In E'voral parts of Paris some owners o' bouEei have shamelessly written on their doors \"\"\"\"Ar,ine\nckstns.\"\"\"\" One could conceive that a National Guard might wvrie \"\"\"\" A7n7 aSa rT ochs dcfcrce,\"\"\"\" in order to cover his re- ,ponsibility as regards the State and bis honour towards hi, feUow citizens, but to inscribs a mark of shame on the front of one's own house is revolting to the Prench chbaracter. I have given orders to the Prefect of Po'ice to cause these inscriptions to be effaced, and I request you to point out to rce the legions in which such things have taken place, in order that I may propose to the President of the Republic to decree their dissolution.'\n\"\"\"\"By decree of the President of the Republic, dated the 'tb, the 5th Legion of the National Guard is dissolved. The motive for this decree was the foUlowing letter to the Minister of the Interior from General Lowoestine\n\"\"\"\"'Monsieur le Ministre,-The National Guard will ap- plaud the sentiments expresed in the letter which you bave done me the honour to address to me. One of the legions of Paris has submitted to the double insult of being disarmed at the hou3es of its members, and the shameful inscriptions of which you speak. The Mairie, notwithstanding the presence of 60 men, was taken by the insurgents. This was the 5th legion. I communicate this fact to you, and call for its disolution. I am happy, on the other hand, to be in posses. mion of a great number of facts which show that the spirit of order and obedience has not ceased to reign in many other legions.'\n,fThe Moniteusr publishes a decree of the President of thie Republic, forming a commission, composed of the President of the Tribunal of Commerce of the Seine, the Mayors of the 2d, 6tb, and8th arrondisse- iments, M. Jay, architect of the city of Paris, and AI. Arnal, physician, to inquire Into and estimate\nIne iDjury received on the 3d, 4th, and 5th, by innocent victims of the insurrection. The same decree opens to the Minister of the Interior a credit of 200,000f. for the first necessities.\n\"\"\"\"The Cobnt;iltionnel says:-\n\"\"\"\"' We have already contradicted the false reports which were current as to the mnanner in which the representatives who were arrested d bden treated. At Vinoennee, in par-\nticular we leern that they were put into the old apartment3 of the Dule de Montpensier, and that General Courtigis treated them with eves) attention,'\n\"\"\"\"The COn4qitWionxe1 has the following -\n\"\"\"\"'A remarkable fct, and which is stated in all the re ports which hbae resched the authorities, in that the work- menhave talkn no part in the late inectios.

One superior officer and 15 soldiers were killed, and three officers and 104 soldiers wounded. Almost aU the latter haTe received most dangerous hurts, having been struck close at hand. This amount of loss is considered a heavy one, looking at the nature of the resistance.\n\"\"\"\"M. Pierre Leroy,Prefect of the Calvados,has been appointed Commissary-Extraordinary of the Govern- ment in the department or the Indre.\n\"\"\"\"The merchants of Rouen, says the Constetionnel\nhave not ceased, during the late events, sending orders to Paris. Some of them, in order to prevent the embarrassment of a commercial crisis, offer to settle their accounts in cash instead of paper. In the other parts of the Seine Inferieure and the sur- rounding departments commerce was no more dis- turbed than it was at Rouen.\n\"\"\"\"The C(ourrier ot Lyons says\nThe opinion wbich prevails in the mass of thetLyonese population, without distinction of classe, is generally one of more or less decided approbation of the act of vigour which has just been accomplished.'\n\"\"\"\" By decrees of the President of the Republic, bearing date the Gth, the following appointments have been made on the proposition of the MiniL ter of the Interior:-M. Maurice Duval is ap- pointed Commissary Extraordinary of the Go- vernment in the departments of the C6tes-du- Nord, the Finistere, Ille-et-Vilaine, Loire- Inf- rieure, Morbihan, Maine-et-Loire, La Vendee, and Ma3enne. M. Carlier, ex-Prefect of Police, has been appointed to a similar post in the depart- ments of the Allier, the Cher, and the Ni6vre, The following appointments of prefects have also taken place :-M. Beaumont-Fassy to the depart- ment of the Aisne, in place of M. Corbin; M. Pierre Leroy, secretary-gsnezal of the Minister of\nthe Interior, to the department of the Calvados, in: the place of M. Morisot ; M. G6rard de Villesaison, sub-prefect of Saint-Omer, prefect of the Baute-\nLoire, in the place of M. do Vidaillan; M. Cl6ment, I mayor of the 12th arrondissement of Paris, to the Orne, in the place of M. Paulze d'Ivoy ; M. Costa, formerly sub-prefect to the Tarn et Garonne, in' place of M. Pardeilhan-Mezin; M. de Tanlay, ex- prefect of the Manche, to the Somme, in place of M. MIasson; and M. Rogniat, formerly sub-prefect, to the Ain, in place of M. Chanal. The decree of November 26 is revoked, in what relate to the ap- pointment of M. do Tanlay to the prefecture of the Indre-et-Loire, M. Brun being maintained in his functions of prefect of that department.\n\"\"\"\" The last accounts received by the Minister of the Interior from the prefocts of department are favourable to the change which has recently taken place in the Government. The following principal towns are particularly mentioned as! en joying the most perfect tranquillity :-Marseilles,' Valence, Montpelier, Blois, Nismes, Lille, Chitteau- rous, Grenoble, Rouen, Strasburg, Colmar, St. Lo, Tulle, St. Etienne, Troyes, Bordeaux, Vend6me, Bayonne, Nantes, Toulouse, Bourges, \\&c. The sub- joined accounts are from non-official sources:-\nAt Rheims, on the 4th, the Sub-Prefect received infor. I mation that a cozop de main, under cover of a pacific de- monstration, was to be made to seize the HOtel de Ville, in oreer to paralize the operations of General do Neuily, whoco arrival had been announced. The Sub Prefect immediately proceeded to the H6tel do Ville, and the Pro- cureur of tho Itepublic, the Commender of the National Guard, and the Central Commiseary of Police were summoned there. After conference with the Mayor, it was resolved that the Gendarmerie, headed by the Com- missary, should proceed to the Place St. Nicaise, in which incendiary proclamations were stuck up, and which was occupied by 200 men, in the midst of whom was a weli known ringleader named Bremsy. Extreme agitation prevailed in the groups, and the most s.laltning news were spread. At the sight of the gendarmerie there was a movement; but Bressy and some others were arrested without any resistance being offered. Documents of a compromising nature were ecized on them ; tho proclamations were torn down, and the crowd was dis- persed. The place was then occupied by a equadron of chas. seurs and part of the gendarmer.e, with six companies of the National Guard, aud a battalion of the 9th Regiment ranged themselves before the Hotel de Ville. In tho meantime a descent was mado by the police in the caf6s da ProgvOs and du Nouveau Monde, which are considered centres of perma nent agitation. After some arrests, which were not effected without resistance, and in the course of which one person menaced the Commissary with a sword, those establishments were clcsed. Patrols on a grand scale were orRanised, and in all quarters, especially in the Faubourg St. Rnmy, the population manifestly gave in its adhesion.\n'At Lille, about 8 o'clock in the evening of the 3d, a crowd assembled on tbe Grand Place, and a man with a long beard, brandishing a large cane, called out \"\"\"\" Iirc la 1lepub- iiqute!\"\"\"\" Some of the crowd added the word \"\"\"\" D'mocratiq?we,' at,d others \"\"\"\" Socialc.\"\"\"\" On this, a number of persons came in from adjacent streets, and joined the crowd. The singing\nof the JMla,ncillaisc then commenced. Disquietude having! been ceused by this demonstration, four commissarios of police, followed by police agents, presented themselves to\ndiseipato it. Resistance was offered, but they succeeded in!; soizing the most riotous. They were roughly assailed, and two of the commissaries, MM. Houze and Loieel, as weU aS soverat agents, were violently struck. But they succeeded in making five men prisoners, and in gettiog them lodged in the lock-up.\n\"\"\"\" 'About 1I0 demagogues of Moulins, armed to the teeth, assembled at a short distance from the town at midnight on the 3d, with the view of releasing their chiefs who were int\ncaicerated on the previous day. The authorities imme' diatoly eont a battdlion of light infantty to the spot. They advanced bileutly, but no sooner did they approach than the lcmnagogues took to flight. They met a second detacbment - finding themselves thus caught they displayed the greatest terror, and fled in all directions. Twelve of them were ar- rested. Muekets have been distributed to the National Guard, and it is proposed to organis8 moveable columns to pi eEerve order. A great number of citizens have already offered their services.\n\"\"\"\"' WVhen the news of the events reached Thiers (Pay de Dfme), tbo Reds assembled and invaded the Mairie. They were, however, soon expeUed by the gendarmerie ; and there- upon they proceeded to the adjacent vill-ges to call out their partisans. Meanwhile the firemen and the citizens devoted to order aesembled at the barriers, armed with fowling pieces. Intimidated at this demonstration, the demagogues deemed it prudent to retreat. A detachment of 200 men was subeequently sent from Clermont, and numerous arrests were made.\n\"\"\"\" ' At Roust,, in the night of the 4th, some few copico of a lithograpaed appeal to reistance were stuck up, but they were torn down, and the authors were subsequently arrested. Seven chiefs of the demagogues were aleo taken into custody. One of them, named Dupont, attempted resistance, but when the crowd were told that he was a Socialist they assisted the oflicer. Another, named Beanfour, had just returned from Paris, where he had bees to receive the mot LVordre of the secret societies.'\n\"\"\"\"The National Guards and the gendarmerie of BelleviUe, having M. Pommier, the Mayor, and M. Michaux, the Deputy-Mayor, at their head, con- ducted themselves with great energy and courage during the late insurrection. The Mayor received information at 4 o'clock, on Thursday, that some hundred demagogues had assembled at the Bar-. riere do la Courtille, and that they were be-\nginning to break open the shops and to plunder the houses for arms. The National Guards being apprised of the fact, hastened to the Mairie to pro- tect it from the insurgeRts. The 4th Company, which arrived the first, guarded the Mairie. An hour afterwards it was announced that the insurgents had raised a barricade. M. Michaux advanced against the insurgents at the head of the gendarmerie, and followed by the 4th company of the National Guards. The barricade was quickly carried. The insurgents fled, or were made prisoners. All the wine shops were then cleared, and tranquillity wsu restored. M. Pommier, the Mayor of Bellevile, with the 6th and 8th oompanies of the National Guards, pursued and dispersed the anarchists in every direction.\n\"\"\"\" You may remember that, amongst other great towns announced as in a state of insurrection simul- taneously with Paris, was Amiens. I have seen a letter from that city, dated yesterday; it is to this effect:-\nW 'e hav receivd tb, news of the Inurrection in Patis.\nAmiens Is profoundly tranquil-as tranquil as our hearts can desire. The act of the President ha. given us all the greatest tatisfaction, witb, perhaps, the exception of the vote en comica; but he haa taken an Immense weight off our heart\\#.'\n\"\"\"\" The Mayor, deputy-mayors, and members of the Municipal Council of the Batignolles have pre- sented the following address to the President of the Republic: -\n\"\"\"\" ' Monsieur le Pr6pident,-We think that we perform an act of patriotism in coming to offer to you our thanks for the immense service which you have rendered to the whole of so. ciety by saving it from narchy and from civil war. We believe that it is the means of consolidating confidence which was reviving and promptly restoring public prosperity You may, theretore, rely on our co-operation in the maintenance of public order. Our population has generally applauded the great act which you have accomplisbed, and its gocd sense guarsntees us that public tranquillity will be no rnore diturbed.'\n\"\"\"\" The Prefect of the department of the Nord has just published the following proclamation:-\n< I Inhabitants of the department of the Nord -France society, and civilisation have triumphed. The enemi's of our homed, of our families, of our present and our futuro are vanquished. The elect of the nation accomplishes b s providential mission for the happiness of France and of Europe.

Our enemies are henceforth powerless to raise barricades. Novertholess, the excite. ment to revolt continues. Ardent demogogues mix with the groups to excite to agitation and circulate false news. The 'Montagnard ex-ropresentatives turn to account the la.t remnants of their old prestige to lead the people with them. Furnished lodging-houses, caf`6, and suspected house3 become the receptacle of conspirators and insurgents. Arms, ammunition, and incendiary writings are concealed there. All the causes of agitation must be suppreesed by practising on a large scale a system of search and arrests. It is the means of restoring to the capital that peace and tranquillity wbich a handful of factious men have sought to tako from it. You bave all dono your duty with so much devotednes3 and courage that I doubt not but that, in order to fulfil this new and important mi,sion, you will display all the vigilance and energy which are called for by circumstances.\n\"\"\"\" ' DE MAUPAS.\n\"\"\"\"All the small posts which were withdrawn at the commencement of the insurrection, to pre- vent the men from being surprised and deprived of their arms, have been replaced.

0FFO-1848-OCT28-004-009\\\\\n\t NA & 23645 & NA & June 13, 1860    & A Royal conqueror once said that, if he wero King of France, not a gun should be fired in Europe without his consent. The meaning of the speech swas that the Sovereign of a country so populous, so compact, and so advantageously placed might, by zhe mere threat of his intervention, impose peace upon all Continental Powers. in substance the doctrine was sound, and we sce its truth expressed by a strange application at the present day. The Emperor of the FRENCnv is in a position to declare. +.hat without his consent not a sword shall remain in its scabbard. He is the arbiter of European peace\nor wvar. When France arms all other nations arm; I vhen she disarms herself other Powers will follow her example. It is a high prerogative, and doubtless gratifying to the national temperament, but we\n-wish it may be exercised in a pacific rather than al 'warlike spirit. \"\"\"\"The Empire\"\"\"\" could reaUly have' been \"\"\"\"peace\"\"\"\" if Louis NAPOLEox had so wvilled it. At this moment the Governmuent of France is engaged in prosecuting the author of a pamtphlet who charged it with incessant meddling, and it must be presumed, therefore, to disclaim a policy of interven- fion and disturbance; but its acts tell, unfortunately, in an opposite direction. What \"\"\"\"question\"\"\"\" is to\nfollow the \"\"\"\" Italian question,' wliat \"\"\"\" idea\"\"\"\" is to I -succeed that of 1859, we caunot predict; but it is! evident that no tranquillity is expected. ThIe\nFrench themselves are as much impressed with the i fact as other people. Their political sky is never clear. They are always on the look-out for a tem- pest, and the Imperial solicitude is v ainly expended in the encouragement of that commerce which will never thrive but in peace.\nWVhy, let us ask, should it cause auy commotion if an interview is contemplated between the Prince Rlegent of PrassiA and the Emperor of the FrrNscu ? Such a meeting, we are assured, is likely to take place at Baden Baden -within a few days, but why should it create any uieasintess or suggest alarm for the settlement of Europe ? Crowned heads have often met, and visits have been interchangted between the ExTrexor aud Queen VTwrosnA. Why, then, should this in- ,erview fill statesmen w-ith speculations and Cabinets with conjectures? The explanation is so notorious that it would be mere afiectation to dissemble the truth. People fear that it imports some new disturbance; that it is tho first act in a new Emropean drama; that Prussia will be sounded about the Rhenish provinces as S.ardinia was sounded about Savoy; that the temptation of cqluivalents may be again forthcoming, and that possibly some fresh annexation may ultimately follow a fresh con- ference and a fresh campaibrn. That is the current talk. Those are the apprehensions now coimmonly prevailing, and who can say they are unwarrant- able ? If we could but assume, which ve are neither entitled nor disposed to do, that Prassia is ns amenable to management as Sardinia was, no might forecast the future with almost as muic'L contidence as we foretell a stormi from the indica- tions of a barometer, and carry two courses of e3vents in two parallel lines from B3aden laden and Plombic?res. France wants her \"\"\"\"natural\"\"\"\" fron- tiers-the Alps amid the rvhine. Savoy has taken her to the Alps,-what is to take her to the Rhiiie ? One transacticn has been closed, is the other to open ?\nAll this is closely in accordance with thc tradi- tions of the First Empire, and of that reign which LOUIS NAAPoLEON naturally regards with admira- tion aud affection. For some ten or twelve years a:t the commencement of the century there was a continual redistribution of European territory, and the licence taken by the First ; NArOLEoX in these niatters was most extravagant. Very recently, too, the historian of those times, MI. THIEnS, has reverted to some of the ideas of the period. In lhis last volume of the Cons\"\"\"\"l.ate ranl tilc Enpire, not once, but repeatedly, and as if expressing an in- contestablo trutbh, o speaks of the Phino and the Alps as the \"\"\"\"natural frontiers\"\"\"\" of France, and directly contrasts those limits, not only with the boundaries imposed in 1815, but witlh the frontiers existing before the wars of the Revolution began. It does not occur to him to reflect that if the Alps and the Rhine are the \"\"\"\" natural\"\"\"\" frontiers of France, nature has never yet prevailed in the arrangement of those frontiers, for there never -was a time, save during the brief convulsions of a revolution, when the French monarchy was tihs bounded. Those, however, are his expres- sions, and they point so clearly to a French \"\"\"\"ideiV' that nobody can mistake their pturport. 'We are ,old that France is now strong, and that she is justified In protesting against the Treaties of iSL;, imposed upon her whon she was weak. But the destruction of those Treaties would not give her her \"\"\"\" natural\"\"\"\" frontiers. She did not possess those frontiers in 14 90, nor at any former period of her history.\nIn promoting his policy, whatever it may be, by personal interviews Louis XAroLEo.N treads closely in the footsteps of his uncle. lie is pro-\n. by a believer in his own powers of persuasion, anid he fully appreciates the other advantages of direct and confidential negotiation. The pre- cedents, however, are not really encouraging either for one side or the other. Xone of the old bar- gains bore any good fruit, and, if The suspicions of Europe on the present occasion rest on any sound foundation, the prospect is a bad one. The French Empire can be consolidated and extended in a far better fashion than this. More was lost than gained by the annexation of Savoy and l!ce. That proceeding was the first cause of the unpopularity of the French Treaty in this country. We might have put up wNith a little dis- advantage in the terms of the bargain, and looked with iudulgence on Protectionist delusions, which, for that matter, we had not long discarded ourselves. WVhat unsettled our views was the discovery that, though France could make a Commercial Treaty with England, she could, at the same time, make treaties quite uncommercial with other States, and that, while she kept 600,000 soldiers in arms, she wvas ready to go to war for an \"\"\"\"idea.\"\"\"\"\nIt is not in any spirit of national jealousy that such feelings are entertained on this side of the Chlanel. WVe do not consider that in any balance of power the strength of France is materially increased by the acquisition of Savoy. WVe should not even much concern onrselves if such increase of strength had actually accrued. WVe know very well that, as far as the power of nations goes, France is far more likely to gain by cultivating the arts of peace than by trying the chances of war. She would be stronger after five yea:s of peaca and disarmament than after ten years of even successful campaigns. iL TamRs, in the volume w-e have already quoted, draws an impressive picture of the condition to which his country had been reduced by those \"\"\"\" vie- \"\"\"\" tories and conquests,\"\"\"\" to which Frenchmen still turn with exultation and pride. The end of all these triumphs was, that even before a single battalion of the Allies had crossed the Rhine France tvas in a state of ruin. The resources of the late dominant and conquering 3Empire were so exhausted that muskets could not be found for the troops levied in haste against the invaders, and such, but for the incomparable genius of the EzrEisoin, was the defenceless position of the nation, that the Allies, if they could have suspected so astounding a truth, might have marched to Paris without a halt at the French frontier. All this was the fruit of war ; and it shows how truly the interests of Franice, no Icss than those of Europe, require that the Second Empire should indeed be based upon peace.

This announcement, though Teally important, and calculated to raise some very grave questions, will be received as a matter of course by the public, so entirely has it been anticipated, from the date of the rebellion itself, not to say earlier. For oue reason or another no one was prepared to see SMirTH O'BRnrm dying the death of a malefactor. The scaffold was either too ignominious, too dignified, or too grave for so silly and contemptible an offender. Ire is not an assassin, Eike THisTLEWOOD; he iS not a murderer, lke GQEENrACRE; he is not a patriot, lke WALLACE; but simply a spoilt child who, partlyfrom pique, partly from imitation, chose to play at the gamte of rebellion. Vanity pointed out the only. pouible line in which-S\\&fr O'BRIEN could hope to be distinguished. Without habits of business, with- out genius, without cotmmon sense, and, above all, without temper, lie courted a people who would not trust him, a clergy who betrayed him, a party which would neither obey him nor manage itself-all in the vain expectation that he would step into the seat of O'CONNELL, and pass thence, perhaps, to the presidency of a republic, if not the traditionary throne of his ancestors. We have seen in this country and in the Senate, that he made himself the jeat of the zation by his peevish and pointless obstinacy. We say it with aU seriousness, that the soleow execution of such a crack-brained mounte- bank would have shocked the national sentiment as much as if the dread ceremonial were performed on a monkey, or a fifth-formschoolboy. We say this of OWB=rN, but really the same applies to all. Their rebellion has been only a Christmas mummery a little out of season.\nWe are not underrating the dangerous eharaoter of the crime,or the amount of mischief which these men might have done. The farce might have turned into a tragedy, and an ocean of blooi might easily have beer shed to satisfy the humour of a few eily boys. There are many things, however, to be taken into ac- count in dealing with crime. The venaltv is not\nmerely according to the mischief. It has respect, also, to the capacity of the author. Ever the tounsel-for. the defence has told the jury, that the prisoners did not know what they were saying ir doing. In the case of EIAGiiER, especially, the jury were entreated to suppose that this lo- quacious and headstrong stripling, had learned X heap of common places about tyranny, patriotism, republicanism, and so forth, and then, in the casual excitement of the crisis, had poured forth a set of senseless philippics in the fdlseto tone of a debating society,or intheunconsciousness of amesmeric france. The jury very properly declined to make themselves responsible for a plea which would have given aU the madcaps and fools in the empire special licence to rebel. As long as the plea of idiotcy was not expressly urged, it was necessary to treat the pri- soners as sane. The punishimient, however, is another question, and one which admits of more considera- tions. Among those considerations ideas of fitness come in, and every body feels that wholesome discipline at Bermuda, of home other safe retire- ments, would suit Mr. MEAGUER!S complaint muich better than the gaRlows.\nIn making these remarks on this particular case, and this knot of delinquents, we are not com- mitting ourselves to the question of capital punishment for, political crimes, On the con- trary, we feel that a vast quantity of twaddle has been talked on this serious subject. We fear that {[}the blood of innocent myriads will still flew through a foolish scruplosity for the life of the rebel. If anybody deserves death on the scaffold, it is the man who arrays citizen against citizen who stains the homnely pavement with the blood of peaceful men, who opens endless qirels, andthrows- the State into confusion,merely because'hehas X fancy for some theory. of government which has never been tried, or because;, ot being: satisfied with his place in. te existing system, he hopes to better him- sell in a scramble. Such men are generally political gamblere, Tiaey are eo imbued with the spirit of\n'chance, and co apt to pTay double or quits\\&ii comMon Affairs, that they;' look to a street 'fig4t- with mote relish than horror,' trusting.that they will not be in tho trif9ing per centage whom thb random bullets maim or kilL What terror thes, is there for such minds? The scaffold. Its tedious preliminaries, 'the trial, the sus- pense, the verdict, the condemned cell, the final Ieave-takikg, the priest, the passing bell, the grim and bratal executioner, the detestable ap- paratus, the rope or the knife, the basket, the coffin, the prison-yard grave, the place in the felon's calendar, the obloquy,-all these are things that tell even upon men ready any day to throw the dizzy die of revolution or the grave. The induigence of a wan- ton and selfish ambition, at the certain cost of both guilty and innocent blood, is murder and something more. They who are guilty of such crimes deserve an ignominious death. When justice speaks unequi- vocally nothing should be allowed to contravene her decision, except a clear case for mercy or prudence. It may be a wise mercy, or a merciful prudence, to mitigate the punishment. But to forgive desperate, hard-headed, and hard-hearted offenders, who have long meditated the crime, and who are certain to re- peat iton the first opportunity, is neither mercy nor prudence. Justice it certa,ily is not., Let not the doom of the murderer be tlpught too'much for the crime, or too bae for ther'iik:of sulch men. We wish that one. rebel should die rather than ten thousand men should follow his example, and, pos- sibly, perish in his stead.\nIt is childish and false to argue that the Govern- Iment of this country is itself founded on revolution; and that treason is only an ill name for resistance, and rebellion for defeat. No mere rebellion has ever permanently succeeded in* this country. The great Revolution of 1688, on which the, present dynasty and overnment stand, was not a resiat- ance to law and authority. It was. the lawful\neistaiie-of the people to the rebellion:of the KING. The Xq was the traitor, and was punished ac- vAihigly-. 'The law of this country defined his'au- thokiy and duties as clearly as it did those of his *tiZjedts. He?set to work establishing a system beside ta'''bove the laws. I he was broughtc to no regular t;ribua, if his punishment was devised with secrecy and effectediforce,that was. simply because the nature of the case allowed no other method of pro- ceeding,inor had the constitution supposed the case of an enemy in the person of the King. But no historical precedents can avail to prove that rebel- lion is not a crime. If it is guiltless, then\nwnat is to iimcer men trom continual re- bellion, and why are we not' to live in a perpetual struggle for change and scramble for power? Why not make a hell upon earth in the sacred name of liberty? The law under which we live is our judge in these matters. Ther4e is no appeal from it. They who violate it do so, at their peril. The only merit of rebellion is that it is a personal risk, and nothing can be so mean and ridiculous as a wish to risk the country and secure one- self. On whom properly fall the risks of a re- belLion ? The rebel or the loyal man? We may have.a, certain respect forthe man who, from astrong sense of oppresson, comes forward to resist the law with a balter iound his i\\&ek.. -hat hater-goes some way to consecrate his cause. We cannot find this redeeming circumstance in the Irish rebellion. For a variety of reasons it was felt,by all,-by none more than the leadera themselves,y-that their own necks were insured, and that if the worst should come to the worst, Government would be merciful to those whom it would no longer fear.\nThe prospect of a mitigated and very mila punish- ment has grown into such a certainty in the course of the trials, as to impart a mock heroic air to the speeches of the prisoners before snteuce.. Waen a man has nothing more terrible in contemu life than a tranquil' and perhaps studious fife in a genial climate, without the. labour and aixiety inseparable frola an honest and. useful career, he can talk very' gracefully 4nd com- fortably of the scaffold and the judgment,-oof his country, his judges, and the other personages of the drama in which he is a.ting. It was our painful duty for months to record and to comment upon the false- hoods, the calumnies, the incentives to hatred, and the instigations to massacre which Mr. T. MEA\\&GHEt freely cast like burning brands on the explosive medium of the Irish temper. We see no truth or piety in a solemn\nreference of such villanous trash to the judge- ment-seat of the ALMIG=; but we ee a good deal of hypocrisy in such an act when to aU appearance the speaker is

It deserves;and -will repay an attentive perusal:-\nPosen, MfarcuS .\n3My dear,-Since I wrote last we bave iffered much and severely, And are- still mncertain what may await us. You have probably Iearned from the public papers that our anxious anticipations of a revolution were continuilly ang- menting. The Goeernment was as much awake to the zymptoms as ourselres, and at three different periods innumerable arrests have tal-en place, each serving to exasperate yet more the youthful portion of our population, who believed that their turn to revolt was- come, for more thanl15years cannot pass without a newgeneration'srenewing the attempts in which their parents have hitherto failed. Our youth have been always the first to rise, and now, more tlhan ever, it has been the very young who have insisted on making tho attempt. In rain the rational refused to take part, with them, saying, \"\"\"\"It is impossible-this is not the moment-let us wait,\"\"\"\"-tkey could not understand thia language, aiid their plans were arranged, extending to every part of ancient Poland: it is even said (and it ia the enemy who say it) that their measures were well concerted. But the Russian police got scent of these plans, and revealed the whole to the Prussian Government, in consequence of which, such enormous numbers were arrested that no snovement) took place here. But it had been arranged that the revolution should commezce everywhere on the same day-at Cracow, where the Government had not been forewarned as it was here, the Austrians on duty in the town were driven out-everything was done In the most admirable order, and with extreme mildness. Except- ing that the Russian and Austrian.eagles were broken and trampled in the dirt, no kind of Tiolence was committed, nor any.spirit of revenge shown, though God knows, the pro- vocation of long years of oppression was not wanting. Those who desired to leave Cracow were at liberty to do so, ana a guard even was given to the Prussian Consul who remained in the town. The previsions government'was fornmed of respectable and moderate persons, and. not a drop of blood was shed, for the Austrians, as usual, fled as soon as they perceived the probability of danger.\nInGaliciathingshave takenamostmelancholyturn. During the 50 years that Gallicia has belonged to the Austrians, they have done all in their power to persuade the people that it had always formed a part of Austria-that Poland had obtained possession of it for some years, and that those years had been very unhappy for the country-that the Poles were their enemies and always treated them as a conquered people, and that since Austria had repossessed herself of Gallicia, the inhabitants were far more happy, and ought to bless their adorable Sovereign and his Go-vern. ment. You, who have so long resided there, know how adorable theyare, and how happy the people; but it is not difficult to persuade those who have no means of knowing better, that things aremuch werse eisewhere. On the other hand, during the last ten years, communist emissaries from Prance havebeen working on this poor people, promising them a revolution iRn which they should first get rid of the nobles, and then share their lands and riches among themselves. There two influences, though emanating from different prin- ciples, tended to the same result-that of setting tho pea- sants against the proprietors. lVhen the revolution of Cra- cow broke out, the GoverDment in Gallicia took the alarm, and formed.guards of safety, composed of the peasants, to whom arms were given, and on the first indication of re- velt (some horses being taken by force from a post-master), a reward oftl florins good money (equivalent to 11. sterling), was promised for every insurgent, living or dead, who should be given up to the Austrian authorities. The spies and agents of the Austrian Government then played their part, intoxicating the peasauts, in order to produce in them the proper degree of excitement, and thus inducing them to massacre some, individuals who attempted to defend them. selves. The promised reward for these bodies having been paid, and the pilage of their houses tolerated, the peasants attacked all they met, in the streets, on the public roads, and even in the houses, and a horrible massacre took place.\nThe troops of the republic of Cracow had repaired to Gal- licia, intending to join the revolution which was to have begun simultaneously with that of Cracow ; but they were met by Austrian regiments far more numerous than them- selves, and receiving no aid from the inhabitants, who had been already massacred, they were defeated and mostly cut to pieces by the excited peasants, the Austrian authorities continuing to pay for every dead bedy brought in, and the Austrian troops looking on, without endeavouring to prevent any of these horrors. I feel, while writing these details, that you wil have difficulty in be- lieving them, and that these to whom they are related must suppose them to be exaggerated, but ray husbahd has just arrived fromn Gailicia, having performed a part of the journey in company with the Vice-President of that province (indeed, it would have beon impossible at that moment to haTe travelled otherwise), and the Vice-President told him that in the whole circle of Tarnow there were not more than three or four proprietors who had escaped the massacre. You mayimagine in what a state we have been. lYhen my husband arrived here, advantage vwas taken of his name to spread the report that he had returned from Galicia, where he had been to commence the revolution, that it had broken out everywhere, that it was quite time to begin it here, aitd that it was disgraeeful that the Government should have so easily succeeded in suppressing it at Posen. Many poor dupes believed this, and an attempted attack on Posen was the consequence; but having neither chief nor plan, and with many spies among theit number, they naturally failed, some were kiled, many arrested, and among them several people in the employ of my husband, which led to the belief that he was concerned in it. Here then was fresh cause for anxiety-a prison awaited him, and for some days we were every moment expecting him to be arrested; this, however, tormented me less than the rest, for, as he positively had nothing to do with it, I had no doubt the truth would soon be evident, and it appears that it is so, for he has not been molested.\nThe students of the college here being suspected, orders were given to four of the masters to visit their homes, and search for arms and other proofs. This, vwhich is the busi. nese of the agents of police, the masters very properly re- fused to do, therefore the college has been closed, it is said for six weeks, but some think altogether. A second college at Tzemaszno is also closed, because suspicions have been awakened as to the fidelity of the pupils to the principles there iRculcated. This is a great calamity. The Govern. ment is now pursuing a sstem of petty prosecutions, with demnonstrations of hatred and revenge towards the entire province, and even towards individuals in no ;way connected with the late movements, which appear to me very dange- rous and ill-advised, for they tend to exasperate those who are most disposed to remain quiet. It is said, that the people in the kingdom (Russian Poland) are beginning to rise; but we have no poitive news, allare intercepted. God knows how it will end. You may conceive that, in such a state of things it ig difficult to find time for letter-writing. Our habitual occupations are not dminiahed; many new duties added; and, as you may muppom, our condition, both soul and body, is deplorable.\nThe children do write, but-sometimes their young imagina-\ntions lead them .to represent things in a manner that makes it impossble to seid their letter3, the impresions of the moment (often terrible) inducing them to form judgments which I should be sorry to transmit to England. Sometimes their letters are not of a nature to be sent to the post, and the difficulties I make about sending their letters dis- courage them from writing. Some have only waited a word of explanation from me, which I have not found a moment to add, and others have been despatched, but r per- ceive have never reached you.\nDo not be uneasy about our persona-nothing will happen tothem. The tomn is fortified and guarded by such an immense number of troops, that it would be madness to attack it. The failure of the first attempt has discouraged the most enterprUiing. If further efrorts are madq, it will be anywhere ratter than Posen, so that we are exposed to no risk; but as to bur poor country-entreat of God to have pity on us, for we are very wretched. We have this moiaeat read in the Giazdte of Warsaw, that the Russians have ont to Oracow their most barbarous troops, Cossacks, Mmul- mans, .and Circauians to exterminate the insurgents, In Gali<a, the peasants will scareely have completed tbeir massaces, wben'they will in their turn be punished by deatih for iihat they aro now paid to do. We aro most unfortu- natel Our Governments say openly, \"\"\"\" Fe thought we had crushed -you long ago, but since you still live, ve will soon fnd means to exterminate ye o!\"\"\"\"\nwhat can I aad to this sad letter ?-hat, tbank God, we still live? it is even difficult to say, thank God, while we live only to witness such honors.

              "1 (noM AM OCCASIOXNL OOREPON1JpT.)\\nFL.ORENCE, ApnL 27.\\nFlorence has this day been the scene of a drama hitherto perhaps unknown in the world-a blood- less revolution. A week since the throne of the Grand Duke seemed no more insecure than that of most Italian Potentates in times of popular com- motion; for the last few days, however, the ex- citement has been gradually rising among all classes burning to know the course the Grand Duke in- tended to pursue in the now inevitable struggle. The procrastination of the Court has vastly increased this feeling, and though a week since a declaration of neutrality might possibly have checked for the mo- ment the passions of the people, it was felt through- out yesterday that nothing short of an immediate decision in favour of Piedmont could prevent a popular demonstration, which could have but one issue. General Ferrari the head of the Tuscan forces, yesterday sent in his resignation, while bands of soldiers and citizens paraded the streets, singing patriotic songs and mingling the names of VictorEmmauuelaudItalianindependence. Through- out the day emisaries of the National party might be seen posting up addresses to the citizens in the most public manner, urging them to throw off the yoke of Austria, and rise in behalf of Italian independence. At an eArly hour this morning, the people (to the number\\nof 20,000) asembled in the Piazza Santa Maria Antonia. Hlere the tricolour of Italy was raised, amid rapturous acclamations, and bands of men of all classes, soldiers and citizens, dispersed them- selves in every direction ; each troop led by a bearer of the national standard. In less than an hour the tricolour was floating over the tower of the Palazzo Vecchio and the fortresses of S. Giorgio and S. Giovanni. The greater portion of the assembly proceeded at once to the Palace of the French M[inister, who thanked the people for their sympathies with the Emperor and France. They then proceeded to the Sardinian Ambassdors. Amid a thousand vivas and the waving of binners he pre- sented himself to the people; reminded them that the eyes of Italy and Piedmont were upon them; exhorted them to respect religion, law, and pro- perty; recommended discipline to the army, quiet and order to all. \"\"\"\" The moment will come,\"\"\"\" he ex- claimed, \"\"\"\"nay, isnowat hand,whenyouwill be called upon to employ your arms in defence of your country He next announced that the Grand Duke had de- clared his intention of abandoning Tuscany, de- manded in the name of Victor Emmanuel and the national honour, that respact should be paid to his peason, and trusted that the citizens would obey the Government that would be organized to meet the present emergency. He then disclaimed on the part of Sardinia any intention of interfering in the affairs of Tuscany, farther than to provide for the public tranquillity and the exigencies of war. The object for which Piedmont drcw the sword was inde. pendence, not ambition. Let them all rememberthat\\nliberty was only acquired by great sacrificesby acts of virtue and entire obedience. Under these circiumL stances the Grand Duke, at an early hour, called upon Don Neri Corsini, Marquis of Lajatico, to aid hia counsels. On his declaring that abdication in favour of his son was the only course that could save the succession, the Grand Duke summoned the corps diploraatique and declared that he preferred quitting the country to condescending to this step. Before the public announcement of tnis the scene before the Palazzo Pitti was most exciting. The very guards and servants of the Grand Duke had mounted the tricolour, while thousands were moving to and fro across the grand piazza. The most im- portant fact was the perfect command which the leaders of the people seemed to possess over each and all. They might be seen going from group to group recommending order i Il tranquillity. Throughout the entire day no single&ct of turbu- lence occurred, as far as I have been able to dig- cover. The cause of this can only be found in the entire unanimity of the people in their hatred of Austria, which so far from being confined to Lombardy and Piedmont is universal through- out the Peninsula. Before 4 in the after- noon it was known that the Grand Duke would quit Tuscany with all his family rather than abdi- cate in favour of the Hereditary Archduke. An address was immediately issued to the people, de. claring that Leopold II., though his opinions coin- cided with those of Tuscany, was on the point of abandoning his country a second time, with al his family. In order to avoid allowing the country to run the risk of a state of anarchy, a Junto was in process of formation, which 'without wishing in any way to influence the future, would undertake to maintain order and give up its authority at the earliest Dossible moment. In the meantime, the wishes of the army of Tuscany would be satisfied, and the Dictatorship of Tuscany offered to Victor Emmanuel during the war. ,\\nGeneral Uloa (it continued) the illustrious de- fender of Venic e, was already on his way to Florence,\\nsent by the King of Piedmont. The Tuscan army would be proud to find him at its head. After an ex- hortstion to order, the first and most solemn act of patriotism, the address wound up with the state- ment that the names of the provisional Government would be given at the earliest moment.\\nAt S the Gruan Duke, with his family and a band of officers (to see him safely to the froatier), left Florence by the Porta Romano, and, crossing the iron bridge above the city, made the circuit of the walls, and followed the road to Bologna from the Porta San Gallo. At 11 o'clock the most perfect tranquillity reigned throughout the city.\\nAPRrL 28.\\nAt an early hour this morning the foltowing pro- clamation appeared:-\\n\"\"\"\" The Grand Dake and his Government, sooner than satisfy the just demands of the country manifested in so many ways and for so long a time, have abandoned it to it- self. At this crisis the municipality of Florence, the only element of authority that still exists, wishing to meet the emergency of Tuscany left withorLt a Government, have nominated the undermentioned to act provisionally.\\n\"\"\"\"Ca.

Whatever be the decidon of the people, society is saved.\\n\"\"\"\"The first part of my task is accomplished.\\n\"\"\"\"The appeal to the nation to terminate the struggles of parties occasioned, I knew, no serious risk to public tranquillity.\\n\"\"\"\"Why should the people rise against me?\\n\"\"\"\"If I bave not your confidence, if your ideas are changed, there is no necewsity to shed precious blood; you have only to deposit in the urn a con- trary vote.\\n\"\"\"\" I always respect the decision of the nation; but, till the nation has spoken, I shall not hesitate at any sacrifice to baffle the attempts of the fac- tious.\\n\"\"\"\" The task, besides, is now become easy. On one band, it has been seen how mad it was to contend against an army united and disciplined, animated by honour and patriotiem; ou the other, the tran- quil attitude of the people of Paris, the reprobation v ithi which they st!gmatized the insurrection, show for whom the capital pronounced.\\nIn the populous quarters where formerly the iii- surrection recruited itself so quickly among the workmen, easy of seduction, anarchy now encounx- tered only the greatest repugnance for its detestable excitements.\\n' Thanks; for such a change is due to the intel- ligent and patriotic population of Paris. Let them be convinced more and more that my only ambition is to secoure the reprcse and prosperity of France.

This rumour was denied by the Consfifutionnel and the Patie, but without much effect, in consequence, perhaps, of the support given by those journals to the policy of the President of the Republic. A cor- respondence has, however, been published which must set the question at rest: the contradiction given to it by Count d'Argout, the Governor of the Bank, is, at all events, entitled to some respect. It is as follows:-\\n\"\"\"\" 'Monsieur is Gouverneur,-It has been rumoured that on tho occasion of late events, 1, as Minister of Finance withdrew from the Bank a sum of 25,0G0,000f. You know that this rumoar bas no foundation, that I confined myself in my despatch of the 27th November to making known to you the intention of the Goveranmett to dispose of that sum, in virtue of the treaty of the 30:h June, 1848, and that I left the Ministry without having withdrawn the 25,000,000, which I wished to keep in reserve for the public Eexvice.

I think there remain no traces of them. Nevertheless, in order to atisty your wish, I declare that en the 27Th of Nova. ber you did me the honour to addren a despatch to me saying that you had the intention of demanding for the Treaury a sum of 25,000,000, forming the completion of a loan of 150,000,000, which the Bank bad engaged to make, in virtue of the treety of the 30th of June, 1818, approved by the decree of the 25th of July following, end reduced to 75,000,000 in virtue of the law of the 6th of August, 1850, a sum on which there had only been yet paid to the Treary 50OWOO,otO.

Symptoms of disturbance bave already manifested themselves in this region of the south, and the evil would assume much more grave propor- tions if the Government did not hasten to apply a remedy by mneans of tho mnost prompt and vigorous measures. On no point of the territory bave secret societies been orga- nized with more union and audacity. They propagat, everywhere the most subversive doctrines, and prepare in sume sort the eventualities of an insurrection. It is impor- tant, therefore, to tranquillize honest men,who are oppressed and menaced with impunity by a minority of agitators. With this view, I have the honour to submit to your sanction a decree, declaring the deparlmonts of the H6rault and the t;ard in a state of siege.'\\n\"\"\"\" The above report is followed in the Monitour bXy a decree of the President of the same date, de claring these two departments in a state of siege.\\n\"\"\"\" The Minister of the Interior has sent a circular to the prefects of departments, containing in- structions relative to the taking of votes in the tsppeal to the people. The following are the prin- cspal points:-\\n'The votes are to be taken on the 20th and 21st inst. The electors are to be the persons who would be entitled to vote in virtue of the Electoral Law of the 1:5th March, 1849 -tbat is to say, all thoeo not labouring under coetain speci. tied diequalifications, who are 21 years of age, and have re. sided six months at least in a commnune. The lists are to bo published at the latest on tho 16th, and are to be definitivelv closed on the 19th. Citizens whose narnes are omitted may call ou the mayors or hJues de e)aLv to insert thom. The votirz is to be continued each day from 8 O'clock to 4. Whs,e thie population is too large to vote entirely in one place, sections may be established. The presidency of the bureau of the voting places is to bo occupied by mayors, deputy-mayors, and munioipal councillore, or ia their ab. sence by persons delegated by iuges de paiar. Each bureau is to consist of a president, four assessors, and a secretary chosen by them from amongst the electors. The asaessors are to be taken from amongst the municipal councillora in the order of inscription, unless tho je'ges de psa; shall have directly proceeded to designate them. Electors are to bring their voting papers ready prepared. They are to contain the word Yes or No, as an answer to the proposition submitted to the people by the President of the Republic They enay be printed or written, and are to be on white paper, without exterior masrks. Wlhon his name is callod, the elector is to present his voting-paper closed; and tbe presi' dent is to deposit it in the baUot box. This box is to have two locks, the key of one of which is to be kept by the pro- sident, the other by the senior assessor. The vote of each elector ia to be recorded by the signatuire or mark of one CS thie members of the bureau in the margin of the list- The names of the electors wilO may not bave voted are to be called over. The ballot boxes are to be sealed up, and deposited durmng the night at the Mlairie, and be protected by a post of the National Guard or the army. The room con taimilng tLhes boxes is to be sealed up. The counting of the vots3 i3 thus to bo proceeded to :-the boxes are to be opened, and the number of votes to be verified. If this number be greater or less than that of the voters, the fact is to be mentioned in the minutes. The counting of the votes is to be made by the members of the bztreau The tabies on which this is to be done are to be ranged in such a way that electors may walk round them Blank voting papers, together with those in which it may be imnpossible to recognise either adhesion or refusal, are lnot to be counted, but are to be annexed to the minutes. Immediately after the counting of the votes, the reeult of the bulot to be published, and the voting papers, with the ex- ception of those annexed to the minutes, are to be burned in presence of the electors. In the communes divided into sec tions, the result of the votes, expressed in each section is to be settled and signed by the bureau, and afterwards be con i-eyed by the president to the bureau of tho first section. who is to mako the addition. The examination of votes for all the departrents are to be made by a commission of three ccuncilior-generaIs to be named by the Prefect.'\\n\"\"\"\" The Minister of the Interior has addressed the following letter, dated the 7th, to the Commander. in-Chief of the National Guiards:-\\n\"\"\"\"'Genera],-In E'voral parts of Paris some owners o' bouEei have shamelessly written on their doors \"\"\"\"Ar,ine\\nckstns.\"\"\"\" One could conceive that a National Guard might wvrie \"\"\"\" A7n7 aSa rT ochs dcfcrce,\"\"\"\" in order to cover his re- ,ponsibility as regards the State and bis honour towards hi, feUow citizens, but to inscribs a mark of shame on the front of one's own house is revolting to the Prench chbaracter. I have given orders to the Prefect of Po'ice to cause these inscriptions to be effaced, and I request you to point out to rce the legions in which such things have taken place, in order that I may propose to the President of the Republic to decree their dissolution.'\\n\"\"\"\"By decree of the President of the Republic, dated the 'tb, the 5th Legion of the National Guard is dissolved. The motive for this decree was the foUlowing letter to the Minister of the Interior from General Lowoestine\\n\"\"\"\"'Monsieur le Ministre,-The National Guard will ap- plaud the sentiments expresed in the letter which you bave done me the honour to address to me. One of the legions of Paris has submitted to the double insult of being disarmed at the hou3es of its members, and the shameful inscriptions of which you speak. The Mairie, notwithstanding the presence of 60 men, was taken by the insurgents. This was the 5th legion. I communicate this fact to you, and call for its disolution. I am happy, on the other hand, to be in posses. mion of a great number of facts which show that the spirit of order and obedience has not ceased to reign in many other legions.'\\n,fThe Moniteusr publishes a decree of the President of thie Republic, forming a commission, composed of the President of the Tribunal of Commerce of the Seine, the Mayors of the 2d, 6tb, and8th arrondisse- iments, M. Jay, architect of the city of Paris, and AI. Arnal, physician, to inquire Into and estimate\\nIne iDjury received on the 3d, 4th, and 5th, by innocent victims of the insurrection. The same decree opens to the Minister of the Interior a credit of 200,000f. for the first necessities.\\n\"\"\"\"The Cobnt;iltionnel says:-\\n\"\"\"\"' We have already contradicted the false reports which were current as to the mnanner in which the representatives who were arrested d bden treated. At Vinoennee, in par-\\nticular we leern that they were put into the old apartment3 of the Dule de Montpensier, and that General Courtigis treated them with eves) attention,'\\n\"\"\"\"The COn4qitWionxe1 has the following -\\n\"\"\"\"'A remarkable fct, and which is stated in all the re ports which hbae resched the authorities, in that the work- menhave talkn no part in the late inectios.

One superior officer and 15 soldiers were killed, and three officers and 104 soldiers wounded. Almost aU the latter haTe received most dangerous hurts, having been struck close at hand. This amount of loss is considered a heavy one, looking at the nature of the resistance.\\n\"\"\"\"M. Pierre Leroy,Prefect of the Calvados,has been appointed Commissary-Extraordinary of the Govern- ment in the department or the Indre.\\n\"\"\"\"The merchants of Rouen, says the Constetionnel\\nhave not ceased, during the late events, sending orders to Paris. Some of them, in order to prevent the embarrassment of a commercial crisis, offer to settle their accounts in cash instead of paper. In the other parts of the Seine Inferieure and the sur- rounding departments commerce was no more dis- turbed than it was at Rouen.\\n\"\"\"\"The C(ourrier ot Lyons says\\nThe opinion wbich prevails in the mass of thetLyonese population, without distinction of classe, is generally one of more or less decided approbation of the act of vigour which has just been accomplished.'\\n\"\"\"\" By decrees of the President of the Republic, bearing date the Gth, the following appointments have been made on the proposition of the MiniL ter of the Interior:-M. Maurice Duval is ap- pointed Commissary Extraordinary of the Go- vernment in the departments of the C6tes-du- Nord, the Finistere, Ille-et-Vilaine, Loire- Inf- rieure, Morbihan, Maine-et-Loire, La Vendee, and Ma3enne. M. Carlier, ex-Prefect of Police, has been appointed to a similar post in the depart- ments of the Allier, the Cher, and the Ni6vre, The following appointments of prefects have also taken place :-M. Beaumont-Fassy to the depart- ment of the Aisne, in place of M. Corbin; M. Pierre Leroy, secretary-gsnezal of the Minister of\\nthe Interior, to the department of the Calvados, in: the place of M. Morisot ; M. G6rard de Villesaison, sub-prefect of Saint-Omer, prefect of the Baute-\\nLoire, in the place of M. do Vidaillan; M. Cl6ment, I mayor of the 12th arrondissement of Paris, to the Orne, in the place of M. Paulze d'Ivoy ; M. Costa, formerly sub-prefect to the Tarn et Garonne, in' place of M. Pardeilhan-Mezin; M. de Tanlay, ex- prefect of the Manche, to the Somme, in place of M. MIasson; and M. Rogniat, formerly sub-prefect, to the Ain, in place of M. Chanal. The decree of November 26 is revoked, in what relate to the ap- pointment of M. do Tanlay to the prefecture of the Indre-et-Loire, M. Brun being maintained in his functions of prefect of that department.\\n\"\"\"\" The last accounts received by the Minister of the Interior from the prefocts of department are favourable to the change which has recently taken place in the Government. The following principal towns are particularly mentioned as! en joying the most perfect tranquillity :-Marseilles,' Valence, Montpelier, Blois, Nismes, Lille, Chitteau- rous, Grenoble, Rouen, Strasburg, Colmar, St. Lo, Tulle, St. Etienne, Troyes, Bordeaux, Vend6me, Bayonne, Nantes, Toulouse, Bourges, &c. The sub- joined accounts are from non-official sources:-\\nAt Rheims, on the 4th, the Sub-Prefect received infor. I mation that a cozop de main, under cover of a pacific de- monstration, was to be made to seize the HOtel de Ville, in oreer to paralize the operations of General do Neuily, whoco arrival had been announced. The Sub Prefect immediately proceeded to the H6tel do Ville, and the Pro- cureur of tho Itepublic, the Commender of the National Guard, and the Central Commiseary of Police were summoned there. After conference with the Mayor, it was resolved that the Gendarmerie, headed by the Com- missary, should proceed to the Place St. Nicaise, in which incendiary proclamations were stuck up, and which was occupied by 200 men, in the midst of whom was a weli known ringleader named Bremsy. Extreme agitation prevailed in the groups, and the most s.laltning news were spread. At the sight of the gendarmerie there was a movement; but Bressy and some others were arrested without any resistance being offered. Documents of a compromising nature were ecized on them ; tho proclamations were torn down, and the crowd was dis- persed. The place was then occupied by a equadron of chas. seurs and part of the gendarmer.e, with six companies of the National Guard, aud a battalion of the 9th Regiment ranged themselves before the Hotel de Ville. In tho meantime a descent was mado by the police in the caf6s da ProgvOs and du Nouveau Monde, which are considered centres of perma nent agitation. After some arrests, which were not effected without resistance, and in the course of which one person menaced the Commissary with a sword, those establishments were clcsed. Patrols on a grand scale were orRanised, and in all quarters, especially in the Faubourg St. Rnmy, the population manifestly gave in its adhesion.\\n'At Lille, about 8 o'clock in the evening of the 3d, a crowd assembled on tbe Grand Place, and a man with a long beard, brandishing a large cane, called out \"\"\"\" Iirc la 1lepub- iiqute!\"\"\"\" Some of the crowd added the word \"\"\"\" D'mocratiq?we,' at,d others \"\"\"\" Socialc.\"\"\"\" On this, a number of persons came in from adjacent streets, and joined the crowd. The singing\\nof the JMla,ncillaisc then commenced. Disquietude having! been ceused by this demonstration, four commissarios of police, followed by police agents, presented themselves to\\ndiseipato it. Resistance was offered, but they succeeded in!; soizing the most riotous. They were roughly assailed, and two of the commissaries, MM. Houze and Loieel, as weU aS soverat agents, were violently struck. But they succeeded in making five men prisoners, and in gettiog them lodged in the lock-up.\\n\"\"\"\" 'About 1I0 demagogues of Moulins, armed to the teeth, assembled at a short distance from the town at midnight on the 3d, with the view of releasing their chiefs who were int\\ncaicerated on the previous day. The authorities imme' diatoly eont a battdlion of light infantty to the spot. They advanced bileutly, but no sooner did they approach than the lcmnagogues took to flight. They met a second detacbment - finding themselves thus caught they displayed the greatest terror, and fled in all directions. Twelve of them were ar- rested. Muekets have been distributed to the National Guard, and it is proposed to organis8 moveable columns to pi eEerve order. A great number of citizens have already offered their services.\\n\"\"\"\"' WVhen the news of the events reached Thiers (Pay de Dfme), tbo Reds assembled and invaded the Mairie. They were, however, soon expeUed by the gendarmerie ; and there- upon they proceeded to the adjacent vill-ges to call out their partisans. Meanwhile the firemen and the citizens devoted to order aesembled at the barriers, armed with fowling pieces. Intimidated at this demonstration, the demagogues deemed it prudent to retreat. A detachment of 200 men was subeequently sent from Clermont, and numerous arrests were made.\\n\"\"\"\" ' At Roust,, in the night of the 4th, some few copico of a lithograpaed appeal to reistance were stuck up, but they were torn down, and the authors were subsequently arrested. Seven chiefs of the demagogues were aleo taken into custody. One of them, named Dupont, attempted resistance, but when the crowd were told that he was a Socialist they assisted the oflicer. Another, named Beanfour, had just returned from Paris, where he had bees to receive the mot LVordre of the secret societies.'\\n\"\"\"\"The National Guards and the gendarmerie of BelleviUe, having M. Pommier, the Mayor, and M. Michaux, the Deputy-Mayor, at their head, con- ducted themselves with great energy and courage during the late insurrection. The Mayor received information at 4 o'clock, on Thursday, that some hundred demagogues had assembled at the Bar-. riere do la Courtille, and that they were be-\\nginning to break open the shops and to plunder the houses for arms. The National Guards being apprised of the fact, hastened to the Mairie to pro- tect it from the insurgeRts. The 4th Company, which arrived the first, guarded the Mairie. An hour afterwards it was announced that the insurgents had raised a barricade. M. Michaux advanced against the insurgents at the head of the gendarmerie, and followed by the 4th company of the National Guards. The barricade was quickly carried. The insurgents fled, or were made prisoners. All the wine shops were then cleared, and tranquillity wsu restored. M. Pommier, the Mayor of Bellevile, with the 6th and 8th oompanies of the National Guards, pursued and dispersed the anarchists in every direction.\\n\"\"\"\" You may remember that, amongst other great towns announced as in a state of insurrection simul- taneously with Paris, was Amiens. I have seen a letter from that city, dated yesterday; it is to this effect:-\\nW 'e hav receivd tb, news of the Inurrection in Patis.\\nAmiens Is profoundly tranquil-as tranquil as our hearts can desire. The act of the President ha. given us all the greatest tatisfaction, witb, perhaps, the exception of the vote en comica; but he haa taken an Immense weight off our heart#.'\\n\"\"\"\" The Mayor, deputy-mayors, and members of the Municipal Council of the Batignolles have pre- sented the following address to the President of the Republic: -\\n\"\"\"\" ' Monsieur le Pr6pident,-We think that we perform an act of patriotism in coming to offer to you our thanks for the immense service which you have rendered to the whole of so. ciety by saving it from narchy and from civil war. We believe that it is the means of consolidating confidence which was reviving and promptly restoring public prosperity You may, theretore, rely on our co-operation in the maintenance of public order. Our population has generally applauded the great act which you have accomplisbed, and its gocd sense guarsntees us that public tranquillity will be no rnore diturbed.'\\n\"\"\"\" The Prefect of the department of the Nord has just published the following proclamation:-\\n< I Inhabitants of the department of the Nord -France society, and civilisation have triumphed. The enemi's of our homed, of our families, of our present and our futuro are vanquished. The elect of the nation accomplishes b s providential mission for the happiness of France and of Europe. Electrified by the name of Louis Napolcon Bon - parte, and confident in him word and in bis devotedness, o,r admirable army has crushed anarby. There can be but one sentiment in the heart of honest men, that of gratitude towards Louis Napoleon Bonaparto; lotus rally round him, and return thanks to Providence, which has chosen him to save us. Inhabitants of the department of the Nord, you have had confidence in the Government and in the Prefect wrho represnts it in the midst of you. I thank you for your patriotic co-operation. \"\"\"\" I BESSON.'\\n\"\"\"\" The Council-General of the department of the Indre-et-Loire, on receiving the news of the Presi- den''s appeal to the people, assembled spontaneously, and voted an address of congratulation to him.\\n\"\"\"\"The ex-representatives of tho Mountain, Car. boneau, of the Gers; Ceyras (Oorreze), Chabert (Ard6che), Chavassieu (Loire), Gavarret (Gers), Gambon (Nievre), Guiter (Pyren6es Orientales), Perdiquier (Seine), Richardet (Jura), have becn arrested during the night.\\n\"\"\"\"We find the following in the Pat e:\\n\"\"\"\"' The President of the Republic having heard that hl.

Yesterday, Lieut.- Colonel de Beville, another orderly officer, went to the hospitals on a similar mission.\\n\"\"\"\" Yesterday morning, General Magnan, the Com- mander-in-Chief of the garrison of Paris, visited the military hospital of the Val de Grace. TIe General entered the different wards, and spoke in the kindest manner to the wounded mop, promising them the notice and protection of tle President of the Republic. Before he left the hospital, he thanked the medical men attached lo the establishment for their attention to the men under their care. From the Val de Grlece the General proceeded to the Hotel Dieu, and afterwards to the other hospitals and amblances where wounded soldiers were lying. Through the whole of his route he was received with loud acclamations.\\n\"\"\"\" The Prefect of Police addressed, on Saturday, the following circular to the commissaries of police of Paris:-\\n\"\"\"\"'The dencute is suppressed. Our enemies are henceforth powerless to raise barricades. Novertholess, the excite. ment to revolt continues. Ardent demogogues mix with the groups to excite to agitation and circulate false news. The 'Montagnard ex-ropresentatives turn to account the la.t remnants of their old prestige to lead the people with them. Furnished lodging-houses, caf`6, and suspected house3 become the receptacle of conspirators and insurgents. Arms, ammunition, and incendiary writings are concealed there. All the causes of agitation must be suppreesed by practising on a large scale a system of search and arrests. It is the means of restoring to the capital that peace and tranquillity wbich a handful of factious men have sought to tako from it. You bave all dono your duty with so much devotednes3 and courage that I doubt not but that, in order to fulfil this new and important mi,sion, you will display all the vigilance and energy which are called for by circumstances.\\n\"\"\"\" ' DE MAUPAS.\\n\"\"\"\"All the small posts which were withdrawn at the commencement of the insurrection, to pre- vent the men from being surprised and deprived of their arms, have been replaced. This shows that the Government feels perfectly confident as to the maintenance of the tranquillity that has been re-established. In the nights of Saturday andyesterday strong patrols of cavalry and ini- fantry however, paraded many of the streets. Nearly all the shops in different parts of tne town were re-opened on Saturday. At most f the theatres there were performances ; last night they were all open. All the law courts he!d sittings on Saturday as usual. The gardens of the Tuileries and of the Palais Royal, and tle court-yard of the Louvre, have agaia n een thrown opea to the public. For the last three days all the principal scenes of the insurrection, and especially the Boulevards, have been visited by large crowds of curious; at some moments the Boulevards *vere sO thronged with pedestriaus and vehicles that it was not easy to obtain a passage.\\n\"\"\"\" M.

              "4 A Royal conqueror once said that, if he wero King of France, not a gun should be fired in Europe without his consent. The meaning of the speech swas that the Sovereign of a country so populous, so compact, and so advantageously placed might, by zhe mere threat of his intervention, impose peace upon all Continental Powers. in substance the doctrine was sound, and we sce its truth expressed by a strange application at the present day. The Emperor of the FRENCnv is in a position to declare. +.hat without his consent not a sword shall remain in its scabbard. He is the arbiter of European peace\\nor wvar. When France arms all other nations arm; I vhen she disarms herself other Powers will follow her example. It is a high prerogative, and doubtless gratifying to the national temperament, but we\\n-wish it may be exercised in a pacific rather than al 'warlike spirit. \"\"\"\"The Empire\"\"\"\" could reaUly have' been \"\"\"\"peace\"\"\"\" if Louis NAPOLEox had so wvilled it. At this moment the Governmuent of France is engaged in prosecuting the author of a pamtphlet who charged it with incessant meddling, and it must be presumed, therefore, to disclaim a policy of interven- fion and disturbance; but its acts tell, unfortunately, in an opposite direction. What \"\"\"\"question\"\"\"\" is to\\nfollow the \"\"\"\" Italian question,' wliat \"\"\"\" idea\"\"\"\" is to I -succeed that of 1859, we caunot predict; but it is! evident that no tranquillity is expected. ThIe\\nFrench themselves are as much impressed with the i fact as other people. Their political sky is never clear. They are always on the look-out for a tem- pest, and the Imperial solicitude is v ainly expended in the encouragement of that commerce which will never thrive but in peace.\\nWVhy, let us ask, should it cause auy commotion if an interview is contemplated between the Prince Rlegent of PrassiA and the Emperor of the FrrNscu ? Such a meeting, we are assured, is likely to take place at Baden Baden -within a few days, but why should it create any uieasintess or suggest alarm for the settlement of Europe ? Crowned heads have often met, and visits have been interchangted between the ExTrexor aud Queen VTwrosnA. Why, then, should this in- ,erview fill statesmen w-ith speculations and Cabinets with conjectures? The explanation is so notorious that it would be mere afiectation to dissemble the truth. People fear that it imports some new disturbance; that it is tho first act in a new Emropean drama; that Prussia will be sounded about the Rhenish provinces as S.ardinia was sounded about Savoy; that the temptation of cqluivalents may be again forthcoming, and that possibly some fresh annexation may ultimately follow a fresh con- ference and a fresh campaibrn. That is the current talk. Those are the apprehensions now coimmonly prevailing, and who can say they are unwarrant- able ? If we could but assume, which ve are neither entitled nor disposed to do, that Prassia is ns amenable to management as Sardinia was, no might forecast the future with almost as muic'L contidence as we foretell a stormi from the indica- tions of a barometer, and carry two courses of e3vents in two parallel lines from B3aden laden and Plombic?res. France wants her \"\"\"\"natural\"\"\"\" fron- tiers-the Alps amid the rvhine. Savoy has taken her to the Alps,-what is to take her to the Rhiiie ? One transacticn has been closed, is the other to open ?\\nAll this is closely in accordance with thc tradi- tions of the First Empire, and of that reign which LOUIS NAAPoLEON naturally regards with admira- tion aud affection. For some ten or twelve years a:t the commencement of the century there was a continual redistribution of European territory, and the licence taken by the First ; NArOLEoX in these niatters was most extravagant. Very recently, too, the historian of those times, MI. THIEnS, has reverted to some of the ideas of the period. In lhis last volume of the Cons\"\"\"\"l.ate ranl tilc Enpire, not once, but repeatedly, and as if expressing an in- contestablo trutbh, o speaks of the Phino and the Alps as the \"\"\"\"natural frontiers\"\"\"\" of France, and directly contrasts those limits, not only with the boundaries imposed in 1815, but witlh the frontiers existing before the wars of the Revolution began. It does not occur to him to reflect that if the Alps and the Rhine are the \"\"\"\" natural\"\"\"\" frontiers of France, nature has never yet prevailed in the arrangement of those frontiers, for there never -was a time, save during the brief convulsions of a revolution, when the French monarchy was tihs bounded. Those, however, are his expres- sions, and they point so clearly to a French \"\"\"\"ideiV' that nobody can mistake their pturport. 'We are ,old that France is now strong, and that she is justified In protesting against the Treaties of iSL;, imposed upon her whon she was weak. But the destruction of those Treaties would not give her her \"\"\"\" natural\"\"\"\" frontiers. She did not possess those frontiers in 14 90, nor at any former period of her history.\\nIn promoting his policy, whatever it may be, by personal interviews Louis XAroLEo.N treads closely in the footsteps of his uncle. lie is pro-\\n. by a believer in his own powers of persuasion, anid he fully appreciates the other advantages of direct and confidential negotiation. The pre- cedents, however, are not really encouraging either for one side or the other. Xone of the old bar- gains bore any good fruit, and, if The suspicions of Europe on the present occasion rest on any sound foundation, the prospect is a bad one. The French Empire can be consolidated and extended in a far better fashion than this. More was lost than gained by the annexation of Savoy and l!ce. That proceeding was the first cause of the unpopularity of the French Treaty in this country. We might have put up wNith a little dis- advantage in the terms of the bargain, and looked with iudulgence on Protectionist delusions, which, for that matter, we had not long discarded ourselves. WVhat unsettled our views was the discovery that, though France could make a Commercial Treaty with England, she could, at the same time, make treaties quite uncommercial with other States, and that, while she kept 600,000 soldiers in arms, she wvas ready to go to war for an \"\"\"\"idea.\"\"\"\"\\nIt is not in any spirit of national jealousy that such feelings are entertained on this side of the Chlanel. WVe do not consider that in any balance of power the strength of France is materially increased by the acquisition of Savoy. WVe should not even much concern onrselves if such increase of strength had actually accrued. WVe know very well that, as far as the power of nations goes, France is far more likely to gain by cultivating the arts of peace than by trying the chances of war. She would be stronger after five yea:s of peaca and disarmament than after ten years of even successful campaigns. iL TamRs, in the volume w-e have already quoted, draws an impressive picture of the condition to which his country had been reduced by those \"\"\"\" vie- \"\"\"\" tories and conquests,\"\"\"\" to which Frenchmen still turn with exultation and pride. The end of all these triumphs was, that even before a single battalion of the Allies had crossed the Rhine France tvas in a state of ruin. The resources of the late dominant and conquering 3Empire were so exhausted that muskets could not be found for the troops levied in haste against the invaders, and such, but for the incomparable genius of the EzrEisoin, was the defenceless position of the nation, that the Allies, if they could have suspected so astounding a truth, might have marched to Paris without a halt at the French frontier. All this was the fruit of war ; and it shows how truly the interests of Franice, no Icss than those of Europe, require that the Second Empire should indeed be based upon peace.

              "5 It has been resolved to Bpare the lives of the con- vioted Irish rebels. This announcement, though Teally important, and calculated to raise some very grave questions, will be received as a matter of course by the public, so entirely has it been anticipated, from the date of the rebellion itself, not to say earlier. For oue reason or another no one was prepared to see SMirTH O'BRnrm dying the death of a malefactor. The scaffold was either too ignominious, too dignified, or too grave for so silly and contemptible an offender. Ire is not an assassin, Eike THisTLEWOOD; he iS not a murderer, lke GQEENrACRE; he is not a patriot, lke WALLACE; but simply a spoilt child who, partlyfrom pique, partly from imitation, chose to play at the gamte of rebellion. Vanity pointed out the only. pouible line in which-S&fr O'BRIEN could hope to be distinguished. Without habits of business, with- out genius, without cotmmon sense, and, above all, without temper, lie courted a people who would not trust him, a clergy who betrayed him, a party which would neither obey him nor manage itself-all in the vain expectation that he would step into the seat of O'CONNELL, and pass thence, perhaps, to the presidency of a republic, if not the traditionary throne of his ancestors. We have seen in this country and in the Senate, that he made himself the jeat of the zation by his peevish and pointless obstinacy. We say it with aU seriousness, that the soleow execution of such a crack-brained mounte- bank would have shocked the national sentiment as much as if the dread ceremonial were performed on a monkey, or a fifth-formschoolboy. We say this of OWB=rN, but really the same applies to all. Their rebellion has been only a Christmas mummery a little out of season.\\nWe are not underrating the dangerous eharaoter of the crime,or the amount of mischief which these men might have done. The farce might have turned into a tragedy, and an ocean of blooi might easily have beer shed to satisfy the humour of a few eily boys. There are many things, however, to be taken into ac- count in dealing with crime. The venaltv is not\\nmerely according to the mischief. It has respect, also, to the capacity of the author. Ever the tounsel-for. the defence has told the jury, that the prisoners did not know what they were saying ir doing. In the case of EIAGiiER, especially, the jury were entreated to suppose that this lo- quacious and headstrong stripling, had learned X heap of common places about tyranny, patriotism, republicanism, and so forth, and then, in the casual excitement of the crisis, had poured forth a set of senseless philippics in the fdlseto tone of a debating society,or intheunconsciousness of amesmeric france. The jury very properly declined to make themselves responsible for a plea which would have given aU the madcaps and fools in the empire special licence to rebel. As long as the plea of idiotcy was not expressly urged, it was necessary to treat the pri- soners as sane. The punishimient, however, is another question, and one which admits of more considera- tions. Among those considerations ideas of fitness come in, and every body feels that wholesome discipline at Bermuda, of home other safe retire- ments, would suit Mr. MEAGUER!S complaint muich better than the gaRlows.\\nIn making these remarks on this particular case, and this knot of delinquents, we are not com- mitting ourselves to the question of capital punishment for, political crimes, On the con- trary, we feel that a vast quantity of twaddle has been talked on this serious subject. We fear that [the blood of innocent myriads will still flew through a foolish scruplosity for the life of the rebel. If anybody deserves death on the scaffold, it is the man who arrays citizen against citizen who stains the homnely pavement with the blood of peaceful men, who opens endless qirels, andthrows- the State into confusion,merely because'hehas X fancy for some theory. of government which has never been tried, or because;, ot being: satisfied with his place in. te existing system, he hopes to better him- sell in a scramble. Such men are generally political gamblere, Tiaey are eo imbued with the spirit of\\n'chance, and co apt to pTay double or quits&ii comMon Affairs, that they;' look to a street 'fig4t- with mote relish than horror,' trusting.that they will not be in tho trif9ing per centage whom thb random bullets maim or kilL What terror thes, is there for such minds? The scaffold. Its tedious preliminaries, 'the trial, the sus- pense, the verdict, the condemned cell, the final Ieave-takikg, the priest, the passing bell, the grim and bratal executioner, the detestable ap- paratus, the rope or the knife, the basket, the coffin, the prison-yard grave, the place in the felon's calendar, the obloquy,-all these are things that tell even upon men ready any day to throw the dizzy die of revolution or the grave. The induigence of a wan- ton and selfish ambition, at the certain cost of both guilty and innocent blood, is murder and something more. They who are guilty of such crimes deserve an ignominious death. When justice speaks unequi- vocally nothing should be allowed to contravene her decision, except a clear case for mercy or prudence. It may be a wise mercy, or a merciful prudence, to mitigate the punishment. But to forgive desperate, hard-headed, and hard-hearted offenders, who have long meditated the crime, and who are certain to re- peat iton the first opportunity, is neither mercy nor prudence. Justice it certa,ily is not., Let not the doom of the murderer be tlpught too'much for the crime, or too bae for ther'iik:of sulch men. We wish that one. rebel should die rather than ten thousand men should follow his example, and, pos- sibly, perish in his stead.\\nIt is childish and false to argue that the Govern- Iment of this country is itself founded on revolution; and that treason is only an ill name for resistance, and rebellion for defeat. No mere rebellion has ever permanently succeeded in* this country. The great Revolution of 1688, on which the, present dynasty and overnment stand, was not a resiat- ance to law and authority. It was. the lawful\\neistaiie-of the people to the rebellion:of the KING. The Xq was the traitor, and was punished ac- vAihigly-. 'The law of this country defined his'au- thokiy and duties as clearly as it did those of his *tiZjedts. He?set to work establishing a system beside ta'''bove the laws. I he was broughtc to no regular t;ribua, if his punishment was devised with secrecy and effectediforce,that was. simply because the nature of the case allowed no other method of pro- ceeding,inor had the constitution supposed the case of an enemy in the person of the King. But no historical precedents can avail to prove that rebel- lion is not a crime. If it is guiltless, then\\nwnat is to iimcer men trom continual re- bellion, and why are we not' to live in a perpetual struggle for change and scramble for power? Why not make a hell upon earth in the sacred name of liberty? The law under which we live is our judge in these matters. Ther4e is no appeal from it. They who violate it do so, at their peril. The only merit of rebellion is that it is a personal risk, and nothing can be so mean and ridiculous as a wish to risk the country and secure one- self. On whom properly fall the risks of a re- belLion ? The rebel or the loyal man? We may have.a, certain respect forthe man who, from astrong sense of oppresson, comes forward to resist the law with a balter iound his i&ek.. -hat hater-goes some way to consecrate his cause. We cannot find this redeeming circumstance in the Irish rebellion. For a variety of reasons it was felt,by all,-by none more than the leadera themselves,y-that their own necks were insured, and that if the worst should come to the worst, Government would be merciful to those whom it would no longer fear.\\nThe prospect of a mitigated and very mila punish- ment has grown into such a certainty in the course of the trials, as to impart a mock heroic air to the speeches of the prisoners before snteuce.. Waen a man has nothing more terrible in contemu life than a tranquil' and perhaps studious fife in a genial climate, without the. labour and aixiety inseparable frola an honest and. useful career, he can talk very' gracefully 4nd com- fortably of the scaffold and the judgment,-oof his country, his judges, and the other personages of the drama in which he is a.ting. It was our painful duty for months to record and to comment upon the false- hoods, the calumnies, the incentives to hatred, and the instigations to massacre which Mr. T. MEA&GHEt freely cast like burning brands on the explosive medium of the Irish temper. We see no truth or piety in a solemn\\nreference of such villanous trash to the judge- ment-seat of the ALMIG=; but we ee a good deal of hypocrisy in such an act when to aU appearance the speaker is not so near that judgment- seat as he was six months ago, when surrounded by his dupes and flattered witlx the hopes of a Gabo- Irish Republic.

              "6 We have been favoured with the fellowi3 g letter, written by a lady of rank in Poses, and addresaed to a,frierd in this country. It deserves;and -will repay an attentive perusal:-\\nPosen, MfarcuS .\\n3My dear,-Since I wrote last we bave iffered much and severely, And are- still mncertain what may await us. You have probably Iearned from the public papers that our anxious anticipations of a revolution were continuilly ang- menting. The Goeernment was as much awake to the zymptoms as ourselres, and at three different periods innumerable arrests have tal-en place, each serving to exasperate yet more the youthful portion of our population, who believed that their turn to revolt was- come, for more thanl15years cannot pass without a newgeneration'srenewing the attempts in which their parents have hitherto failed. Our youth have been always the first to rise, and now, more tlhan ever, it has been the very young who have insisted on making tho attempt. In rain the rational refused to take part, with them, saying, \"\"\"\"It is impossible-this is not the moment-let us wait,\"\"\"\"-tkey could not understand thia language, aiid their plans were arranged, extending to every part of ancient Poland: it is even said (and it ia the enemy who say it) that their measures were well concerted. But the Russian police got scent of these plans, and revealed the whole to the Prussian Government, in consequence of which, such enormous numbers were arrested that no snovement) took place here. But it had been arranged that the revolution should commezce everywhere on the same day-at Cracow, where the Government had not been forewarned as it was here, the Austrians on duty in the town were driven out-everything was done In the most admirable order, and with extreme mildness. Except- ing that the Russian and Austrian.eagles were broken and trampled in the dirt, no kind of Tiolence was committed, nor any.spirit of revenge shown, though God knows, the pro- vocation of long years of oppression was not wanting. Those who desired to leave Cracow were at liberty to do so, ana a guard even was given to the Prussian Consul who remained in the town. The previsions government'was fornmed of respectable and moderate persons, and. not a drop of blood was shed, for the Austrians, as usual, fled as soon as they perceived the probability of danger.\\nInGaliciathingshave takenamostmelancholyturn. During the 50 years that Gallicia has belonged to the Austrians, they have done all in their power to persuade the people that it had always formed a part of Austria-that Poland had obtained possession of it for some years, and that those years had been very unhappy for the country-that the Poles were their enemies and always treated them as a conquered people, and that since Austria had repossessed herself of Gallicia, the inhabitants were far more happy, and ought to bless their adorable Sovereign and his Go-vern. ment. You, who have so long resided there, know how adorable theyare, and how happy the people; but it is not difficult to persuade those who have no means of knowing better, that things aremuch werse eisewhere. On the other hand, during the last ten years, communist emissaries from Prance havebeen working on this poor people, promising them a revolution iRn which they should first get rid of the nobles, and then share their lands and riches among themselves. There two influences, though emanating from different prin- ciples, tended to the same result-that of setting tho pea- sants against the proprietors. lVhen the revolution of Cra- cow broke out, the GoverDment in Gallicia took the alarm, and formed.guards of safety, composed of the peasants, to whom arms were given, and on the first indication of re- velt (some horses being taken by force from a post-master), a reward oftl florins good money (equivalent to 11. sterling), was promised for every insurgent, living or dead, who should be given up to the Austrian authorities. The spies and agents of the Austrian Government then played their part, intoxicating the peasauts, in order to produce in them the proper degree of excitement, and thus inducing them to massacre some, individuals who attempted to defend them. selves. The promised reward for these bodies having been paid, and the pilage of their houses tolerated, the peasants attacked all they met, in the streets, on the public roads, and even in the houses, and a horrible massacre took place.\\nThe troops of the republic of Cracow had repaired to Gal- licia, intending to join the revolution which was to have begun simultaneously with that of Cracow ; but they were met by Austrian regiments far more numerous than them- selves, and receiving no aid from the inhabitants, who had been already massacred, they were defeated and mostly cut to pieces by the excited peasants, the Austrian authorities continuing to pay for every dead bedy brought in, and the Austrian troops looking on, without endeavouring to prevent any of these horrors. I feel, while writing these details, that you wil have difficulty in be- lieving them, and that these to whom they are related must suppose them to be exaggerated, but ray husbahd has just arrived fromn Gailicia, having performed a part of the journey in company with the Vice-President of that province (indeed, it would have beon impossible at that moment to haTe travelled otherwise), and the Vice-President told him that in the whole circle of Tarnow there were not more than three or four proprietors who had escaped the massacre. You mayimagine in what a state we have been. lYhen my husband arrived here, advantage vwas taken of his name to spread the report that he had returned from Galicia, where he had been to commence the revolution, that it had broken out everywhere, that it was quite time to begin it here, aitd that it was disgraeeful that the Government should have so easily succeeded in suppressing it at Posen. Many poor dupes believed this, and an attempted attack on Posen was the consequence; but having neither chief nor plan, and with many spies among theit number, they naturally failed, some were kiled, many arrested, and among them several people in the employ of my husband, which led to the belief that he was concerned in it. Here then was fresh cause for anxiety-a prison awaited him, and for some days we were every moment expecting him to be arrested; this, however, tormented me less than the rest, for, as he positively had nothing to do with it, I had no doubt the truth would soon be evident, and it appears that it is so, for he has not been molested.\\nThe students of the college here being suspected, orders were given to four of the masters to visit their homes, and search for arms and other proofs. This, vwhich is the busi. nese of the agents of police, the masters very properly re- fused to do, therefore the college has been closed, it is said for six weeks, but some think altogether. A second college at Tzemaszno is also closed, because suspicions have been awakened as to the fidelity of the pupils to the principles there iRculcated. This is a great calamity. The Govern. ment is now pursuing a sstem of petty prosecutions, with demnonstrations of hatred and revenge towards the entire province, and even towards individuals in no ;way connected with the late movements, which appear to me very dange- rous and ill-advised, for they tend to exasperate those who are most disposed to remain quiet. It is said, that the people in the kingdom (Russian Poland) are beginning to rise; but we have no poitive news, allare intercepted. God knows how it will end. You may conceive that, in such a state of things it ig difficult to find time for letter-writing. Our habitual occupations are not dminiahed; many new duties added; and, as you may muppom, our condition, both soul and body, is deplorable.\\nThe children do write, but-sometimes their young imagina-\\ntions lead them .to represent things in a manner that makes it impossble to seid their letter3, the impresions of the moment (often terrible) inducing them to form judgments which I should be sorry to transmit to England. Sometimes their letters are not of a nature to be sent to the post, and the difficulties I make about sending their letters dis- courage them from writing. Some have only waited a word of explanation from me, which I have not found a moment to add, and others have been despatched, but r per- ceive have never reached you.\\nDo not be uneasy about our persona-nothing will happen tothem. The tomn is fortified and guarded by such an immense number of troops, that it would be madness to attack it. The failure of the first attempt has discouraged the most enterprUiing. If further efrorts are madq, it will be anywhere ratter than Posen, so that we are exposed to no risk; but as to bur poor country-entreat of God to have pity on us, for we are very wretched. We have this moiaeat read in the Giazdte of Warsaw, that the Russians have ont to Oracow their most barbarous troops, Cossacks, Mmul- mans, .and Circauians to exterminate the insurgents, In Gali<a, the peasants will scareely have completed tbeir massaces, wben'they will in their turn be punished by deatih for iihat they aro now paid to do. We aro most unfortu- natel Our Governments say openly, \"\"\"\" Fe thought we had crushed -you long ago, but since you still live, ve will soon fnd means to exterminate ye o!\"\"\"\"\\nwhat can I aad to this sad letter ?-hat, tbank God, we still live? it is even difficult to say, thank God, while we live only to witness such honors.
